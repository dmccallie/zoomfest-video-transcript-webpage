00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.990
Hastings Hart: Hey? Don't know.

2
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.079
Sumner McCallie: You doing all right?

3
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760
Hastings Hart: I'm doing good. How are you?

4
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.220
Sumner McCallie: I'm doing all right.

5
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.449
Sumner McCallie: We're in the process of moving.

6
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.850
Hastings Hart: Oh, wow!

7
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.130
Sumner McCallie: On canvas. So tomorrow the movers come so.

8
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.040
Hastings Hart: You're staying on. You're staying on campus just another.

9
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.549
Sumner McCallie: On campus. There's a there's a house that has opened up. That's it's stunningly gorgeous. I mean, it's 1 of those that we will never live in a house this nice

10
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:06.123
Sumner McCallie: I'm sure.

11
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.950
Hastings Hart: So.

12
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.550
Sumner McCallie: But it is. Yeah, it's it's really wonderful. So.

13
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.520
Hastings Hart: That's great. Well, hope it goes well. Moving is one of the most horrible things.

14
00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:21.710
Sumner McCallie: Well, we'll say moving on campus is great. Because, hey, Eleanor, how are you?

15
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.355
Sumner McCallie: Hey? I think I got it.

16
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.610
Sumner McCallie: Yeah. Moving on campus is great.

17
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.699
Mel Cooper: Belle and I are going to actually sit together.

18
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.400
Sumner McCallie: Oh, wonderful!

19
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.329
Sumner McCallie: Oh, that's great! That's great! That makes perfect sense.

20
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.130
Mel Cooper: He's coming in a minute.

21
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.380
Sumner McCallie: Okay.

22
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.639
Mel Cooper: So so, Sumner thanks this so efficient, it told me right at the beginning. It's being recorded. It's going to be transcribed by AI.

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.351
Sumner McCallie: That's right. That's right.

24
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.802
Sumner McCallie: That'll include our conversation right now.

25
00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:50.560
Hastings Hart: Oh!

26
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.129
Mel Cooper: Really oh dear!

27
00:01:52.449 --> 00:02:15.480
Sumner McCallie: It's just that works. One of the things we've got it we're working on is with faculty parent conferences. What's been funny is we turn them on, and then we we set it so that the faculty member can just stay on as parents then cycle through but we've we're gonna have to turn off the the AI companion because I don't need everyone to be sent. Everyone's information.

28
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.460
Mel Cooper: Oh!

29
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.740
Sumner McCallie: So.

30
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.399
Mel Cooper: Will will the will it automatically send it to those on the.

31
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:46.399
Sumner McCallie: We can set it so. So we had to change our settings. We've changed it so that it automatically turns it off. You'd have to turn it on. I just don't think it's fair to parents, even if they don't know that it's happening. I want to be clear on that. But also. Yes, you can also set it so that it only sends to the host, or it sends to whoever else. So it's it was kind of funny, and what I can do at this point as well. Just so you have it. I can make both of you Co. Hosts

32
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.794
Sumner McCallie: on this as well, so that that way you'll get whatever is sent.

33
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.050
Mel Cooper: Oh, fantastic, great! Well, I I really feel

34
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.039
Mel Cooper: stupid and bad about last time, because that was such an important one to record.

35
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.809
Mel Cooper: I think we did get a recording. Finally, I mean.

36
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.639
Sumner McCallie: No, it did, it did, and it didn't seem to face Uncle Spencer at all. Me just.

37
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.790
Mel Cooper: Well, he's had knee surgery, so

38
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.929
Mel Cooper: he's been through a lot, and and I hope he'll be here today. But he may not. He wasn't feeling too good yesterday.

39
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.789
Sumner McCallie: Okay, we'll figure that out.

40
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.589
Sumner McCallie: and I'll just as people come on. I'll let them in and make sure they know that they're

41
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.200
Sumner McCallie: Hello, zoom user. There it is, I think.

42
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.047
Hastings Hart: One assumes it's a family member.

43
00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:43.810
Mel Cooper: Zoom user, you need to click your microphone.

44
00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:47.160
Sumner McCallie: Let us know who you are.

45
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.479
Sumner McCallie: I was, I was telling Hastings we're in the process of moving. So tomorrow is our move day on campus. There's a

46
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.965
Sumner McCallie: a house that's kind of a domino effect. Those houses come open. That we'll slide into, and then let someone slide into this house.

47
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:19.009
Sumner McCallie: so we've done all. If you were to look around, everything is in boxes, we have nothing. We we've actually had 2 or 3 days when the house was ready, but the moves couldn't happen because of the rain, which was great. So we have taken I don't know how many trips you know little Subaru. Back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth.

48
00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:21.479
Mel Cooper: Which house are you moving to?

49
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:41.060
Sumner McCallie: So it's it was one of the Bill Croft was in our Dean of Resident's life was in it as well most recently, and he's he's moving right across from us, where Kenny Scholl has been for a number of years, and it's a wonderful house. We will never live in a house, this nice ever again. It's it's the most amazing amazing thing it has.

50
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:56.300
Sumner McCallie: It was Redone, old 19 thirties, 19 twenties house, I think, and when it was Redone. It was Redone. Well, Bill Croft made sure that it it had all the the nice amenities, and so but it it'll be great with the the neatest thing for us is just having a room for each of the guys.

51
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.860
Zoom user: Hey!

52
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.650
Sumner McCallie: That's a great one. So, Uncle Franklin, how are you good to see you.

53
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.809
Zoom user: We're fine. Aunt Teresa's beside me.

54
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.840
Sumner McCallie: Hey! Wonderful!

55
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.490
Zoom user: She says, no, no, don't show me. Don't show me, I said. You're fine. Everybody want to see you, but

56
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.939
Zoom user: she's given me the order.

57
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.730
Sumner McCallie: Well, if it's a couple story at some point, we need to at least hear from her.

58
00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:21.130
Zoom user: Oh, I've I've got

59
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.759
Zoom user: some stories, I truthfully. I really want to hear the younger people's stories. I've been telling mine for

60
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.750
Zoom user: 84 years time for you guys.

61
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.919
Sumner McCallie: Well, I hope I hope that Grady is able to jump on because Grady and Fawn met at a Pesticides conference, and I think that's the best.

62
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.295
Sumner McCallie: the best meeting place forever.

63
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.419
Mel Cooper: Have you encouraged him? Did you encourage him to.

64
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.154
Sumner McCallie: I did reach out. We do. Yeah, he'll he'll be able to or not. But I I was. I'm hopeful, but.

65
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.790
Mel Cooper: I wanted your mom and dad to be sure to jump on.

66
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.659
Sumner McCallie: I think their plan is to. I hope there is. Yeah.

67
00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.060
Zoom user: At least, at least. Your Aunt Teresa's. Your Aunt Teresa and I met on a church bus

68
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.679
Zoom user: going going to Big Ridge State Park for a church week, ritual.

69
00:06:09.822 --> 00:06:11.830
Sumner McCallie: Great! Isn't that nice?

70
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.440
Sumner McCallie: Very proper?

71
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.069
Zoom user: Did you? Did you meet Katie in Mongolia, or someplace like that?

72
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:36.140
Sumner McCallie: No, no, that's great. So I actually met Katie at habitat, who was connected with habitat. The story about Mongolia is that someone on the trip, said, Are you all getting married? And Katie said, Well, I have no idea, and I thought Well, I I thought we probably would, I mean.

73
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.569
Sumner McCallie: and once again clueless, just clueless in all this. So we we went on our honeymoon before before we were sort of formally engaged.

74
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:54.820
Zoom user: Somebody asked me at 16 if Teresa and I were getting married. I said, hell, yes, scare the.

75
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.200
Mel Cooper: I never agreed to that.

76
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.460
Ellen Cochrane: Got it.

77
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.650
Sumner McCallie: There's always a smart one in the pair.

78
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.970
Zoom user: You did originally agree to it, though. Right?

79
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.880
Zoom user: What?

80
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.949
Zoom user: You know, what? I'm getting her off this thing. This is bad.

81
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.969
Hastings Hart: Hey, l and d.

82
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.089

Ellen Cochrane: Thanks. I'd like your haircut, Eleanor.

86
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.990
Mel Cooper: To me.

87
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.650
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah.

88
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.519
Mel Cooper: Oh, thank you, no, I have. I have a new haircutor.

89
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.020
Mel Cooper: and he's Iranian. Did you see my Facebook.

90
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.469
Ellen Cochrane: I did see that post, you know.

91
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:43.999
Mel Cooper: And he holds the razor, so I don't complain. I just say yes, yes, I really like it.

92
00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:50.595
Ellen Cochrane: Mine uses scissors. Yeah, that that razor wouldn't.

93
00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:54.150
Mel Cooper: It's a little. Hi, Joni!

94
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.009
Joanie's New iPad: Hi! Everybody! Happy Valentine's day.

95
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.740
Mel Cooper: That's right.

96
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.250
Mel Cooper: Snow out there in Denver.

97
00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:08.490
Joanie's New iPad: It's melting. It's a sunny day today. We keep getting a little bit. The mountains were hammered, but Denver not so much so.

98
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.179
Joanie's New iPad: It's good we get, you know, an inch or 2 or 3, maybe.

99
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.869
Joanie's New iPad: So it's yeah. It's fine. It's fine, have you? Have you had bad weather? Have you all had really bad weather.

100
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.660
Mel Cooper: No.

101
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.679
Joanie's New iPad: Oh, good!

102
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.589
Sumner McCallie: But L and D, you all had some snow recently. Right? Yeah, we.

103
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.460
Ellen Cochrane: Just constantly.

104
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:27.960
Joanie's New iPad: Yeah.

105
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:39.530
Ellen Cochrane: Not a lot, I mean once was maybe about 6 inches 6 to 8. But now they're calling, starting on Tuesday, I think. Tuesday and Wednesday. Maybe up to a foot.

106
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.469
Joanie's New iPad: Oh, wow!

107
00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:44.509
Joanie's New iPad: I I think you all are have gotten more snow than we have.

108
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:49.639
Joanie's New iPad: because every time I speak to Alison she complains that the kids are out of school.

109
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:55.129
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah, it's been. It's been too much. And then also bitter cold.

110
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.660
Joanie's New iPad: Yes.

111
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.250
Ellen Cochrane: Like.

112
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.300
Ellen Cochrane: I go out only for groceries, and only if it's a real necessity.

113
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.480
Joanie's New iPad: Right? Right? Yeah. The the cold is, yeah.

Sumner McCallie: Hey, Wyatt, how are you?

117
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.609
Wyatt & Joanie: Hey! Let me get this. Let me get all adjusted. Here.

118

120
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:20.890
Joanie's New iPad: Hi.

Wyatt & Joanie: Yes, my wife tells me that frequently.

122
00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:27.260
Ellen Cochrane: Well.

123
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:33.289
Joanie's New iPad: I don't think you're maladjusted. I think you're adjusted just well.

124
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.580
Joanie's New iPad: Oh.

128
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.040
Wyatt & Joanie: I don't. You know. I don't see Franklin's picture online. Let's see, let me see what.

129
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.010

146
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.929
Jim McCallie: A fan. There's not very much here, it echoes.

152
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.993
Joanie's New iPad: He said, Dad, all my friends, their parents, give them their call.

153
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.416
Jim McCallie: Teaching you responsibility, Paul, and

154
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.430
Ellen Cochrane: That's his exam.

155
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.909
Jim McCallie: Yeah. Oh, did he pass? What was the question?

156
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.150
Ellen Cochrane: Has he passed his exam yet.

157
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:10.610
Jim McCallie: Yeah. He took his final Cpa exam. There's 4, and he passed it. And oh, wow!

158
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.950
Jim McCallie: He's got yeah. So.

159
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.770
Wyatt & Joanie: Why?

160
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.140
Jim McCallie: So that's that's pretty impressive.

161
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.809
Ellen Cochrane: It's very impressive.

162
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:26.849
Jim McCallie: And then we're gonna fly. We're gonna spend a week with Paul, and then we fly out March 10th to Austria and stay a week in Vienna, and then we're gonna go to Innsbruck, where we're gonna live

163
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.199
Jim McCallie: for indefinite amount of time.

164
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.539
Ellen Cochrane: Oh, really. So you're moving.

165
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.550
Jim McCallie: Oh, yeah, we're moving.

166
00:11:34.472 --> 00:11:36.040
Jim McCallie: I I called.

167
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.299
Jim McCallie: This is my 1st death, because it's

168
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:49.390
Jim McCallie: as you all can imagine, and death. You don't take anything with you, and that's kind of what we're doing. We have really gotten rid of everything

169
00:11:49.740 --> 00:12:15.580
Jim McCallie: no furniture is going with us plates, maybe a few plates, cooking pots. But other than that really no furniture whatsoever, no tools, no power tools any of that stuff. None of them are going with us, so we've had to get rid. That's what the owner, I think, is kind of referring to. We've had a a couple of sales on mostly for our church and for the neighborhood, and then marketplace

170
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.049
Jim McCallie: Facebook marketplace, but not too much on that.

171
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:35.029
Jim McCallie: And then yesterday we had for about 2 or 3 h. People come by mostly again from our church, and we just gave it away. I mean, you know, it's like you can take that or take that, or don't you need this? I have to admit when it's free. People have a lot a lot less inhibition to buy it.

172
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.640
Jim McCallie: Why.

173
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.900
Ellen Cochrane: Exactly.

174
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.300
Ellen Cochrane: That's what I've heard. That's how to have an estate sale.

175
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.230
Jim McCallie: Yeah, exactly.

176
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.050
Jim McCallie: So we're we're stripped down pretty much

177
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.529
Jim McCallie: pretty empty. We're at a dining.

178
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.020
Tom 4: Hello!

179
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:56.421
Jim McCallie: Now, which you can't see. But that's sold to our neighbors. The chairs are sold to someone else that we're sitting in now.

180
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.180
Jim McCallie: kind of amazing.

181
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:07.809
Ellen Cochrane: That is, I just I look around and I can't figure out where to begin how I'm going to do it. You know, I identify pieces of furniture that I would take.

182
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.490
Jim McCallie: Right.

183
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.760
Mel Cooper: Hey, Tom!

184
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.220
Ellen Cochrane: The only useful one is a bed, but I'm sorry.

185
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.310
Jim McCallie: Oh, I just.

186
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.909
Mel Cooper: Just welcoming Tom 4, and Tom 3, and Allison.

187
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.150
Mel Cooper: Charlie's here.

188
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.060
Jim McCallie: Yeah, Carly.

189
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.170
Zoom user: You know you would.

190
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.340
Tom 4: Hello, Buddy!

191
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.109
Zoom user: You were talking.

192
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.800
Mel Cooper: Hello!

193
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.380
Zoom user: Move trista.

194
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.999
Mel Cooper: How is it in Berlin?

195
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.375
Ellen Cochrane: Apparently you look so different.

196
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.090
Zoom user: Teresa and.

197
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.042
Tom 4: Yeah, no, I.

198
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.730
Zoom user: Teresa and I have never moved without a you won't.

199
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.540
Zoom user: Filled to the brim. Yeah, with everything we owned at that time.

200
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.290
Tom 4: I am.

201
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.850
Zoom user: Which means, on the other end you empty it and start again.

202
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.169
Jim McCallie: Yeah, no, it's tough.

203
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.390
Zoom user: It was. It wasn't fun every time.

204
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.580
Tom McCallie: Well, Jim solved that problem with an ocean.

205
00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:07.226
Joanie's New iPad: Yeah.

206
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.820
Helen: Yeah. And Coca-cola's not paying to move you.

207
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.940
Jim McCallie: Yeah, that makes a huge difference.

208
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.460
Helen: Woo.

209
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:29.981
Jim McCallie: I was. I was telling people yesterday, I said, Yeah, when when a corporation moves you, it's very easy. They just come in and they move everything. And when we move from Zimbabwe to South Africa, they actually move the trash as well.

210
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:38.848
Jim McCallie: Oh, yeah, they packed that up. We were wondering what it was on the other end, and I realized they just packed up the whole trash can.

211
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.150
Jim McCallie: But yeah.

212
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.900
Mel Cooper: All right, Thomas. I'm gonna give you time. Now, how's Berlin?

213
00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:51.240
Tom 4: Berlin is good. Yeah. Talking about moving. I also moved. Last month.

214
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.839
Jim McCallie: Yeah. Oh.

215
00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:02.140
Tom 4: So I helped my parents in the middle of January with their move, doing doing whatever I was told to do. And then I came back, and I had 2 weeks until I do my own move.

216
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.010
Joanie's New iPad: Are you still in Berlin, Tom?

217
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.960
Helen: Debbie into a big place, or what.

218
00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:17.670
Tom 4: Yeah. So in the same city I I had to move because the the lady I was renting from she kind of just had enough, just like it was too much effort for her.

219
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:32.160
Tom 4: and it was not possible for me to take over the contract. So I was forced out. Basically. And I had to find a new place. And I'm living in a different neighborhood and in a bigger apartment before I was living by myself in a

220
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:40.030
Tom 4: like 2 2 room apartment. And now I'm living with 2 people, and it's a 4 room apartment.

221
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:55.949
Tom 4: So it is bigger, and it is a lot more to do here, and I will have like one of the rooms in the studio. So it's it's definitely leveled up in regards to having a lot more space. I have to walk from one side of the apartment to the other. It takes a while, so that's a new feeling for me.

222
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.410
Helen: You like the people? Are they friends that you're living with? Or you just got mashed together.

223
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.589
Tom 4: No, no, it was I chose them so one of them is my girlfriend.

224
00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:09.780
Tom 4: Oh, and.

225
00:16:10.224 --> 00:16:10.669
Wyatt & Joanie: Choice.

226
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:16.659
Tom 4: And yeah. And then the other person is a friend, a mutual friend of ours.

227
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.370
Tom 4: who was living here already as well. So yeah.

228
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.580
Mel Cooper: So you and your girlfriend moved in with someone else. That's what it sounds like.

229
00:16:26.129 --> 00:16:28.420
Tom 4: Well, she was. She's been living here the longest. She.

230
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:28.810
Mel Cooper: You don't.

231
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.540
Mel Cooper: Oh.

232
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.781
Tom 4: Okay, well, it's too late.

233
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.810
Mel Cooper: Yeah.

234
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.749
Tom 4: Well, I see. I see Becky and Megan.

235
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.410
Mel Cooper: Hello! Hello! Good to see y'all.

236
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.140
Becky & Megan: From snowy Boston.

237
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.480
Tom 4: And I thought you were going to be in DC. This weekend, Becky.

238
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:56.520
Becky & Megan: No, I think I have my dates mixed up. I was in DC. A couple of weeks ago for a good friend's 30th birthday, so that was fun.

239
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.749
Mel Cooper: Oh, well, good! We're glad you're both together. That's great.

240
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.920
Mel Cooper: that's great. Well, this this topic must have some appeal.

241
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:14.309
Mel Cooper: Oh, well, we'll any any other news to catch up on it. We'll wait just a few more minutes. Anybody else got some

242
00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:16.279
Mel Cooper: reports.

243
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.479
Joanie's New iPad: Did we lose Jim?

244
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.049
Mel Cooper: No, he's still on. He's just got his picture up.

245
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.140
Mel Cooper: Maybe he's looking for Martina.

246
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.810
Joanie's New iPad: Oh, okay.

247
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.479
Jim McCallie: Yeah, I'm I'm we're still here. It's just we're eating, and no one likes to watch.

248
00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:32.320
Ellen Cochrane: That's right.

249
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.274
William Pressly: Just a flight.

250
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.230
Wyatt & Joanie: And.

251
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.330
Helen: Mom, did you do the drawing of your father?

252
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.617
Jim McCallie: No, no, he did not. That comes from

253
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:56.480
Jim McCallie: Wall street journal. Anybody can actually have that done it's the typical all street Wall Street Journal style that they have, and you can send your photo in, and it comes back in about 30 seconds.

254
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.640
William Pressly: Oh, really.

255
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.460
Jim McCallie: Yeah.

256
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.220
Helen: It's wonderful.

257
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.099
Tom 4: Oh, are you talking about? Oh.

258
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.210
Tom 4: yeah, that's not a drawing, or that doesn't look like a drawing. That's why I was confused.

259
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.870
Jim McCallie: Yeah, it's not. It's I don't know what you call that, Tom. You can explain it. I don't know.

260
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.830
Helen: Huh!

261
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:20.199
David McCallie: It's an algorithm. It's it's just an algorithm that goes through your image and replaces

262
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.140
David McCallie: light and dark with patterns, little stipple patterns.

263
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.950
Jim McCallie: Yeah, okay.

264
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.070
David McCallie: It's cool.

265
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.759
Zoom user: Did that from the Wall Street Journal.

266
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.059
David McCallie: Yeah, they're famous for using those

267
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:43.280
David McCallie: little drawings of their of the authors of the articles, and I guess I didn't know that you could have it done

268
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.190
David McCallie: with your own photo. That's cool.

269
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.364
Jim McCallie: Yeah, you could tell everybody. It was when you wrote one of those famous editorials.

270
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.470
David McCallie: Infamous, infamous! Well.

271
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.660
Jim McCallie: Infamous, add a call.

272
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.480
Zoom user: I have written a couple, but they didn't make the Wall Journal.

273
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:14.279
McCallie’s: You were asking about news I'll I don't see any of that family represented here so or at least not directly

274
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:22.200
McCallie’s: breaking all sorts of hipaa rules. Spencer's in the hospital as of 2 o'clock this morning.

275
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:35.145
McCallie’s: Had Kathy called me at 1230, or something was having chills he's about 2 weeks out from having a knee replacement. I think it's been a pretty tough go of it, Franklin. Helen may know more, but

276
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:48.857
McCallie’s: uncontrolled chills turn out. He had a hundred 2 fever went to, so he's down at Erlanger. I haven't talked to Kathy since this morning they were in transition to a room. So I don't know if anybody knew that or everybody knew that. But

277
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:57.829
McCallie’s: be aware, be in your prayers be in your thoughts. I I guess he had moved back out of

278
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:13.830
McCallie’s: rehab into so I think, Sarah, he got Sarah to call Kathy at midnight or something, and she got over there, and he was just having uncontrolled chills and moaning. And just I talked to him, and he was lucid, but just

279
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:22.519
McCallie’s: couldn't, couldn't figure out what was happening. And then it became obvious he was having fever, and that kind of got the wheels turning so don't know anything else. But

280
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.474
Mel Cooper: That's the news, and if I broke hip laws, I've got lawyers in the family who can defend me. There you go!

281
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:40.510
Mel Cooper: Thank you for that. And we we recall the wonderful job he did a month ago. It was just fantastic, so I'm glad we did that before his knee surgery.

282
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.969
Zoom user: I'm glad you shared that. This is Franklin. I had no idea

283
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.419
Zoom user: he was there. You're telling me that Theresa and me.

284
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.010
William Pressly: Good.

285
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.619
Zoom user: I appreciate your saying, and I

286
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.330
Zoom user: I have. No. He was up

287
00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:01.200
Zoom user: limping, of course, with his knee. Just yesterday we saw him.

288
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.659
Zoom user: I'm I'm surprised and amazed and worried.

289
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:20.059
McCallie’s: Yeah. And I I don't know the how you take care of Sarah. I know that's been a big part of the whole challenge with his getting his knee down and being in rehab, and all those kinds of things, and their kids have done a

290
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:28.369
McCallie’s: great job of supporting both of them. But now he's downtown, and she's up on the top of the mountain, and all those kinds of.

291
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.830
Helen: Hmm.

292
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:35.069
McCallie’s: Thing. So see what you hear as things come out, and there you go.

293
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.070
Mel Cooper: Okay.

294
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.540
Helen: Hmm.

295
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.970
Zoom user: Thank you. Thank you.

296
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.300
Marshall McCallie: Back! Called.

297
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.090
Zoom user: Do our duty.

298
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.806
Marshall McCallie: I called Spencer, and then

299
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.300
William Pressly: Karen answered the phone. She's with Sarah.

300
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.889
Marshall McCallie: Karen's taking care of Sarah.

301
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.899
Marshall McCallie: They were checking for septic sepsis.

302
00:21:53.555 --> 00:21:59.189
Marshall McCallie: But think it's probably more likely to be flu, and I hope that's the case.

303
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.310
William Pressly: Let's hope it's the flu that sepsis with the knee is just terrible.

304
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.210
David McCallie: Yeah.

305
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.660
William Pressly: You know they'll they'll hand that, and it's not good.

306
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:17.119
Marshall McCallie: We're having in Chattanooga. We're having a lot of flu here in Transylvania County, the hospitals filling up with

307
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.680
Marshall McCallie: patience.

308
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:43.950
McCallie’s: Yeah, we've had a lot. I know Macaulay's been hit pretty hard. I take care of the Borders and Sumners, shaking his head. They've had a you know. Maybe I may be aware of 30 of the borders that had it. And that didn't talk about the day students and talk about the adult population and the Ems when they were Spencer shares last night

309
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.030
McCallie’s: at the 3rd call I had the they were saying, you know

310
00:22:49.300 --> 00:23:05.409
McCallie’s: the hospital's kind of jammed right now, and he may go down there and just wait. And there's a lot of flu, and this that and the other. And I said, I understand. But I think he needs to go down there be seen because it's not gonna go away tonight or tomorrow. So I think

311
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:12.519
McCallie’s: I'm glad to hear that flu is on the list of possibilities, because that would make sense. But we'll see.

312
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.360
Ellen Cochrane: Hmm.

313
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:24.530
Mel Cooper: Well, another good reason to have these zoom zoom calls. Alright I think we're here, Marshall and Amy. Hi again say hello, but good to see y'all

314
00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:42.550
Mel Cooper: so let's see, Hastings, you wanna 1st we're gonna thank Sumner for the link this time and for the it's recorded. And AI generated summary will be. And and transcript, too. Right?

315
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:55.479
Mel Cooper: So, this is really, we're doing good here and but Hastings is still our manager, and you've gotten photos from people you want to kind of update us and tell us how you think this will go.

316
00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:05.919
Hastings Hart: Yeah. So we've got photos from Allison, David, Nancy Presley, Wyatt, Jane Presley, Jack and Eleanor

317
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:14.230
Hastings Hart: Allison's got quite a bunch. Most David's got 9. Most of everybody else has about 3 or 4.

318
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.429
Hastings Hart: So just

319
00:24:16.894 --> 00:24:28.245
Hastings Hart: what? And the photos just came to me, you know, with cryptic file names. I put the name of the person who sent them in front of them, so I'll just call up the photos by person. What you'll see is

320
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.680
Hastings Hart: thumbnails on the left, and you can just tell me which photo you want me to bring up to the front at any given point.

321
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:43.180
Mel Cooper: Just a second before we get started on that. Is there anyone who knows at this point that you want to tell a story, even though you don't have any photos submitted.

322
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.370
Mel Cooper: Just a verbal story.

323
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:56.030
Mel Cooper: Okay? Well, you may be inspired to do so. So we will definitely leave time for that, and there will also be interaction with

324
00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.079
Mel Cooper: with what goes on. So

325
00:24:59.668 --> 00:25:05.600
Mel Cooper: but I will kind of keep a time. Just so we we get at least everybody who's

326
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.760
Mel Cooper: signed up to to speak. All right.

327
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:14.779
David McCallie: And hey things. When you get to me I can do my own presentation like you suggested. I'm I'm ready to do that with.

328
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.960
Hastings Hart: Great. Okay. Thank you.

329
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.280
David McCallie: Sharing, assuming screen sharing is turned on.

330
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.379
Hastings Hart: Yeah, it's everybody has the ability to share. So.

331
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:36.320
Charleigh Robinson: And I'm the opposite. I shared photos, but I don't need to speak. I was just trying to add to the you asked for wedding photos, and who was there? So that's what I sent. But I don't necessarily have a story prepared. So I'm I'm the anti volunteer, please.

332
00:25:36.607 --> 00:25:37.469
Ellen Cochrane: I was just.

333
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.109
Ellen Cochrane: It was a wonderful wedding. It was wonderful.

334
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:51.210
Charleigh Robinson: I'm happy to talk about any of the pictures, but I love weddings, and I love taking pictures. So I sent Hastings, basically, whatever I have. So it was a great trip down Memory Lane.

335
00:25:52.320 --> 00:26:00.840
William Pressly: She wants to be part of the family.

336
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:03.650
Mel Cooper: We were gonna start with you.

337
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.320
Charleigh Robinson: Oh, okay.

338
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.750
William Pressly: Okay.

339
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.959
Mel Cooper: Is that comfortable for you.

340
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.750
Charleigh Robinson: Sure I just that was the easy part.

341
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.040
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah, okay, just go through your pictures.

342
00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:27.740
Charleigh Robinson: So I sent pictures from any Macaulay wedding I had. I actually had one of my of Queenie and T. Hook that I forgot to send, but maybe Wyatt sent those. So this is Joanie and Wyatt

343
00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:46.159
Charleigh Robinson: right after they got married they got married in Mom's parents home. It was a very small wedding, maybe the smallest Macaulay wedding on record. I don't know for sure. But that's Joni and Wyatt, Mom and Dad, you can talk about you. You should talk about your day, and how young you were.

344
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.350
McCallie’s: What year were you at.

345
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.520
Charleigh Robinson: Babies.

346
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.230
Marshall McCallie: Hmm.

347
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.650
Joanie's New iPad: This was. This was on November 13, th 1971.

348
00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.630
Joanie's New iPad: So Wyatt was 27, and I was 23,

349
00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:28.260
Joanie's New iPad: and we just had family members at the wedding, and then my best friend from college, who I lived with. And then my mom had a dinner, a very nice dinner at the house, for maybe there were 12 of us, or 14 of us. I can't remember exactly how many, and Tom came with Elizabeth.

350
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.419
Joanie's New iPad: and John came and Alex came.

351
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:45.999
Joanie's New iPad: Jim was 71. I were you in Jackson Hall, Jim? I can't remember, and Eleanor was in, were you? You were in California.

352
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.300
Mel Cooper: That was in California.

353
00:27:47.300 --> 00:28:01.650
Joanie's New iPad: Okay, yeah. So that was pretty far for them to come. So you know we had we. We just had a lovely time, and it was very intimate. And I think that's Tom, who is the best man.

354
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:06.770
Charleigh Robinson: Yeah, Hastings, there. Ha! Has another picture of of the Macaulays that were there.

355
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:07.650
Joanie's New iPad: Okay.

356
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.440
Charleigh Robinson: Hastings, can you do need to do that?

357
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.070
Hastings Hart: And no, yeah, I'll I'll

358
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:20.329
Hastings Hart: okay. I am. I'm zoom yeah, I can't. I'm like, I don't ever do zoom. So you tell me if you

359
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:28.070
Hastings Hart: well, I can either just kind of go through these in the order they happen to come up, or if you want, you know you can. If if there's 1 you know you want, I can go to that one now.

360
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.850
Charleigh Robinson: The one right below go up.

361
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.680
Charleigh Robinson: It would just be. The next one is, who is Mom?

362
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.279
Joanie's New iPad: Oh, yes, yeah. I see.

363
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:35.650
Charleigh Robinson: Yes. Yeah.

364
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.250
Joanie's New iPad: Yep.

365
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.879
Sumner McCallie: But, Jim, so how did you meet Wyatt? How did you all connect.

366
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.819
Joanie's New iPad: Wyatt, do you want to tell the story? You want me to.

367
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.811
Wyatt & Joanie: Will it be significantly different? This is

368
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:55.000
Wyatt & Joanie: about time, I mean, we've got about 8 or 9 people that want to talk. So if you.

369
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.530
Mel Cooper: Don't worry. I will call the time.

370
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.040
Charleigh Robinson: I can.

371
00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.170
Wyatt & Joanie: See if my minutes.

372
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.799
Charleigh Robinson: You, Dad, if you want. So I didn't.

373
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.550
Wyatt & Joanie: Alright, I cause I have my own.

374
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:14.329
Wyatt & Joanie: my own picture, that, and or that's important to a story. But I can get to that later. But Joni and I met at a party in

375
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:24.220
Wyatt & Joanie: Groton, Connecticut, when I was in the submarine service, and she was a co-ed at Connecticut College for women.

376
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.185
Wyatt & Joanie: and

377
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.709
Wyatt & Joanie: That was the best party I've ever ever attended, and

378
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:35.540
Wyatt & Joanie: I owe everything to it. So that's all I'm going to say. At this point.

379
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.609
Joanie's New iPad: So Alex, in this picture, I believe, was 12.

380
00:29:42.183 --> 00:29:45.049
Joanie's New iPad: No. 11. He was 11,

381
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:50.220
Joanie's New iPad: I think, because he was born 60. Yeah, he was 11, John was.

382
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.949
Joanie's New iPad: how how much older is John and Alex? 6 years he was 1718, maybe.

383
00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.690
Wyatt & Joanie: 10 years.

384
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.990
Joanie's New iPad: And oh, he's 10 years. Okay, so he's 21.

385
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:10.769
Joanie's New iPad: Tom is 29, and then, you know, grandmother and granddad, and why? And me.

386
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:28.519
Charleigh Robinson: And I have the champagne flutes. Now that my, that mom, that Joni's mom served at that dinner as we clean out Onion Earp's house. I now have the champagne flutes from that day. So that's how I've carried their

387
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.890
Charleigh Robinson: their love into our home.

388
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.829
Mel Cooper: Oh, that's sweet!

389
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:33.200
Charleigh Robinson: Yeah.

390
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.749
Wyatt & Joanie: As a side note. Alex drank champagne from those flutes at age 11 and a half.

391
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.929
Zoom user: Some of the birds in.

392
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.600
Ellen Cochrane: Next week.

393
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.730
Mel Cooper: Keep going.

394
00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.660
Ellen Cochrane: Oh!

395
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.200
Charleigh Robinson: Right, so.

396
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.740
Ellen Cochrane: This is.

397
00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:58.499
Charleigh Robinson: Ryan's in my wedding. So this is Denver. September 17, th 2,005,

398
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:09.949
Charleigh Robinson: and we had a pretty good Macaulay turnout. I think so. Mom's mother was from Denver. So we have a lot of family in Denver, and I think

399
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:22.820
Charleigh Robinson: the Mccauley's are used to being the most having the most family, and Mom's side was probably about equal, and all the Macaulays were shocked that another family could have so many

400
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:23.460
Charleigh Robinson: family

401
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:52.110
Charleigh Robinson: members in attendance at something, because, you know the competitive Macaulay nature. It's always, you know, the most, and we win. And I don't know that they actually had the most that we had, that the Macaulays represented the most. So they were. I laughed because when we did the 2 family pictures, they I remember the Mccauley's talking about how Mom's family had a lot of numbers as well. So yeah. So I loved that, you know so many of

402
00:31:52.320 --> 00:32:15.339
Charleigh Robinson: my grandparents generation. So grandmother made it. Aunt Eleanor and Uncle Mel, you know, got her there, which was amazing. Mom's mom was also there, so I had my 2 grandmothers at my wedding, which was really special for me. To be so late in life and still have grandparents present, was a huge blessing, but also Aunt Ellen and Aunt Matt and Uncle David were there, so I was very blessed to have

403
00:32:15.758 --> 00:32:31.310
Charleigh Robinson: that generation at our wedding so, and I loved my wedding there, so Hastings will scroll down. I had the best time in my wedding. I just danced all night, but so did everybody else. So there's Uncle David and Aunt Ellen and Uncle Alex.

404
00:32:32.355 --> 00:32:34.620
Charleigh Robinson: Helen and Sarah.

405
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.949
Charleigh Robinson: And then in the next picture, that baby is Eva Louise.

406
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.220
Charleigh Robinson: So which is hard to

407
00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:48.779
Charleigh Robinson: believe. You know that she's a 20 something in college now or 19, maybe she I yeah. So

408
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.139
Charleigh Robinson: so we had fun. Franklin and Teresa are in one.

409
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.180
Sumner McCallie: Now it's gonna happen.

410
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.860
Charleigh Robinson: And please.

411
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:03.120
Charleigh Robinson: So I love that everybody came. It's a blessing, you know, to celebrate the the good times together. I've

412
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:13.831
Charleigh Robinson: I've tried to instill in my kids. You just you show up for things to me that's love, you know, like love is being there. And you make the effort and you go

413
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.350
Charleigh Robinson: And then there's 1 of Rachel and Helen dancing.

414
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.119
Sumner McCallie: Allison, how did you and Brian meet.

415
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:47.380
Charleigh Robinson: So Brian and I met in Philly through Carrie, Carrie and Brian were at Penn together. In medical, you know, medical school class. They were in the same Med School class together. Brian actually saw me for the 1st time on Saint Patrick's day, but I was still in college. I had gone to Philly to visit Carrie. I was a senior in college. I was thinking about moving to Philadelphia after I had graduated, so I went out and visited her for a weekend, and we all we were at a pub

416
00:33:47.678 --> 00:34:07.409
Charleigh Robinson: for Saint Patrick's day, and I was sitting in a booth by, like all the coats. I didn't really know anybody, so I wasn't mingling or interacting much. And he came. He saw me. He didn't know who I was. He asked someone who it was. They said, oh, that's Carrie's sister visiting. He figured he'd never see me again, so he did not bother even

417
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:16.217
Charleigh Robinson: interacting, cause you know he's like, what are the chances that I'll ever see this girl again? So much to his surprise, I showed up in Philly.

418
00:34:16.815 --> 00:34:17.090
Ellen Cochrane: Like.

419
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.009
Charleigh Robinson: Later in the summer, the end of summer, after I

420
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:37.894
Charleigh Robinson: gone home to Colorado for a bit after graduation, and I moved to Philly and Carrie and I live together, and lo and behold! He realized, this girl is back, and finally, a few months later, got the nerve to ask me out for a drink. So that's how we met. It's all. It's all Carrie's fault. I blame her

421
00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:39.559
Charleigh Robinson: so.

422
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.969
Charleigh Robinson: My last picture is just me and grandmother, which I love again. I just felt so blessed that

423
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.890
Charleigh Robinson: that they were there. So

424
00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:58.103
Charleigh Robinson: and then this is the next one's Carrie's wedding, and again we had a good contingency of of Macaulay's present she and Alex got married.

425
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:13.339
Charleigh Robinson: in Santa Cruz in 20 in May of 2014. So that's that was them, and then the next one's Rachel and Jason's wedding.

426
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.060
Joanie's New iPad: Oh!

427
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320
Mel Cooper: Hmm.

428
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:39.064
Charleigh Robinson: Everyone looks so young, and all these pictures so, and then Carrie and Alex again. I I love the I love when people you know, people walking down the aisle having just been married, I think just everybody's faces. There's just pure joy. And then there's me and Brian walking down the aisle. Babies, babies.

429
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.670
Charleigh Robinson: and then

430
00:35:40.670 --> 00:36:05.240
Charleigh Robinson: we had Eleanor. So we were at Eleanor and John's wedding. They got married in DC. In 2010, I believe. October of 2010 and Eleanor had a great. So the next picture I know Aunt Ellen also made her wedding because she would have been in Winchester at that time. So got, and Elizabeth with Aunt Eleanor, and I don't know who the 2 women.

431
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:09.459
Charleigh Robinson: anybody, and Eleanor, do you know who's in the picture with you.

432
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:10.870
Mel Cooper: Don't know them.

433
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:11.770
Charleigh Robinson: Okay.

434
00:36:12.794 --> 00:36:20.159
Charleigh Robinson: and then the last picture was just some of the cousins. So I just I love being able to, to, you know.

435
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:28.649
Charleigh Robinson: go support whomever in our family for the for the special memories. So those were my contributions.

436
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.000
Mel Cooper: My goodness.

437
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.469
Ellen Cochrane: Row, in.

438
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.250
Mel Cooper: Mild.

439
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.430
Mel Cooper: Hmm.

440
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:43.860
Ellen Cochrane: I just want to say quickly, Alison, when my mother died and she was out in Winchester, and it was just a small little service at the retirement home.

441
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:51.399
Ellen Cochrane: I'm wandering around in the room seeing people, and when I bumped into you I was just astounded. I, you and Charlie were together.

442
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.250
Charleigh Robinson: We did. We.

443
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:59.130
Ellen Cochrane: I it was just. I'll never forget that it was the loveliest thing. And it really struck me like, Oh.

444
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.779
Ellen Cochrane: that's really, that's really important. These family things are really important. And I just.

445
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.360
Charleigh Robinson: Down.

446
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.710
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah, thank you for that.

447
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:20.530
Charleigh Robinson: You're welcome. Yeah, the celebratory ones and the sad ones. I feel like. That's you know you. You do your best to make it if you can, and cause it means something to people. So I'm glad that it meant something to you.

448
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.959
Helen: Oh, go ahead!

449
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.669
Charleigh Robinson: Coach to you. You do a great job of it, and I think you learned it from your parents.

450
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:37.639
Charleigh Robinson: I I would 100% agree, Jack. I mean we we didn't miss a Christmas from, you know, the year I was born we missed it, but didn't miss it again till I got married so, and that was 27 years.

451
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.020
Helen: Yeah, yeah.

452
00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:42.660
Helen: I mean, Allison, one of my favorite members.

453
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.000
Charleigh Robinson: Ma'am.

454
00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:52.320
Helen: One of my favorite memories of your wedding is when Aunt Queenie walks in in her beautiful blue, and then.

455
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.994
Charleigh Robinson: Your mother's mother walks in in that gorgeous red.

456
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.580
Helen: It was so touching to me. I will always remember that.

457
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:19.290
Charleigh Robinson: Thank you. Yeah. It was. I gave them each a bouquet. Instead of tossing my bouquet, I gave each of my grandmas a bouquet, and just talked about their legacy as matriarchs of of both sides of my family. So it was very special.

458
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.950
Mel Cooper: Oh, Allison, thank you so much for sharing so many.

459
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.000
Charleigh Robinson: Yeah.

460
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.310
Mel Cooper: Happy faces. Good, all right, but we will move on to the next one.

461
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.200
Mel Cooper: So Hastings, who's next.

462
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.659
Hastings Hart: Couple from Jack.

463
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:45.400
McCallie’s: So so this is a tribute to the family. So when Francis and I were engaged, the

464
00:38:46.315 --> 00:39:09.470
McCallie’s: T. Hooks and Tom and Elizabeth and Melan Elner had a party at Melan Elner's house in Poolside, no less. It was French theme, I believe, and the the Waitstaff was quite unique. And there there they are! There were 3 of the wait staff. So we had a

465
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:20.980
McCallie’s: a nice evening, and and I love that that picture of help helping us celebrate Francis. You have any added comments.

466
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.189
Mel Cooper: I remember it well. I'm still recovering. I do, too.

467
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.140
McCallie’s: I I know Mel did the cooking. I'm sure I couldn't tell you what he cooked, but we

468
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:37.489
Mel Cooper: I I still have the handwritten note that I had taken to Aunt Queenie.

469
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.080
McCallie’s: I think we went by their house when we got engaged, and they weren't home.

470
00:39:42.220 --> 00:40:06.189
McCallie’s: So we wrote him a note and just said, we're engaged and came by to tell you about it, and stuff and typical, and Queenie, some, many years later she sent it back to me as memento, which I still have. So that was just things that Aunt Queenie was very good about. She loved to keep things and give them back to you and help you remember what you'd done in your brighter times.

471
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.780
Helen: Oh!

472
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.009
Mel Cooper: But you have another one.

473
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:26.330
McCallie’s: Yeah, this is just the the the immediate family. I love the 2 Anna and and Andy in it. David, Nancy, Alan this Alan was not married yet, so I beat him to it.

474
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.350
McCallie’s: our

475
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:51.460
McCallie’s: family of on the side there Elnora, Morgan, Alan, and David and I would say she helped raised us raise us. She was, we called her our maid, and she was just a big part of our youth, and growing up, and lots of stories to tell. The man is Charles Ragland, and Charles was a big part of the Macaulay family.

476
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:57.538
McCallie’s: Charles worked for lots of the family.

477
00:40:58.952 --> 00:41:06.200
McCallie’s: he worked. I think he worked for Aunt Ann, and maybe Uncle Park. I know he worked for Mother K.

478
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:14.290
McCallie’s: Is that just an incredible just a very nice man who did

479
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:43.060
McCallie’s: all sorts of work around our house. Mom said he was great indoor and outdoor. She could let him shine the chandelier, or mow the grass, or whatever, but he was always there on Saturdays. He told me I took care of him as a patient. I took care of his his wife, who lived to be 101 years old. Charles said he remembered when Daddy came home from the hospital as a kid.

480
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:50.159
McCallie’s: And sometime recently I found Mother Kay's

481
00:41:50.260 --> 00:42:04.309
McCallie’s: will and just her notes to Daddy, her only son, about where she wanted furniture to go, and who got it, and this, that, and the other. It was her handwritten, you know. Make sure that

482
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:22.779
McCallie’s: so and so gets this, that and the other. And she said, and take care of Charles is a thousand dollars too much, or do you think 500 is more appropriate? So this is back in the sixties, and it was just a tribute of Mother K to Charles Raglan, who had been

483
00:42:23.092 --> 00:42:48.430
McCallie’s: part of many of the Macaulay family over over generations. Truly generations. And I just thought that was kind of neat to see Charles, and he was. He was at our wedding, and we were glad to have him be there, and just it was. It was kind of neat, but I don't know if anybody else has memory of Charles. Aside from I know David does, but I don't know if if Helen, shaking her head so just kind of it was fun to show that part of our family.

484
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:59.270
Helen: When Grandmother Macaulay would go out of town, she would give Mother Charles's days simple.

485
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.289
Helen: We could have Charles then.

486
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.069
Zoom user: Charles was a lovely man. You have described him exactly correct.

487
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.140
Zoom user: All of us felt that.

488
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.919
Zoom user: And I was up at my mother's house when

489
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:19.670
Zoom user: Charles was doing work, had nice, quick talks with him.

490
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.430
Zoom user: Then he went back to work.

491
00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:22.980
Zoom user: He didn't mess around. He worked.

492
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:34.314
McCallie’s: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm still on

493
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:36.830
Mel Cooper: Loose.

494
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:38.900
Mel Cooper: Absolutely.

495
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.140
Mel Cooper: Andrew.

496
00:43:40.512 --> 00:43:43.117
McCallie’s: I'm gonna read something if I can.

497
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:51.016
McCallie’s: So I have a letter that is in my dad's handwriting.

498
00:43:54.050 --> 00:44:12.609
McCallie’s: September of 1951. He's just gotten engaged to my mom, and they got married in November. So he's in Philadelphia doing his medical training. And she's in Chattanooga and

499
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:23.299
McCallie’s: So this is September. They've just gotten engaged, and they get married in November. So that gives you a sense of the timeframe. And it's a letter that he writes to

500
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:39.439
McCallie’s: my grandmother, Mrs. Lupton. mom's mom. She is a widower mom's the oldest of 3. So she's a widower. Mom's the 1st to get married. Daddy's in Philadelphia.

501
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:59.389
McCallie’s: obviously a pretty quick turnaround time. And so this is just classic. Daddy writing this letter dated Sunday, 23rd of September. That would be 1951, pardon me, trying to hand read his handwriting. It's worse than mine, dear Mrs. Lupton, for some time now I have been wanting to write you a note

502
00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:14.009
McCallie’s: as a sort of follow up to our conversation last July, but since Madden and I had no definite plans until recently. I hardly knew what to say. But now, presto! So much has happened so quickly that I hardly know where to start.

503
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.389
McCallie’s: I think that I can bullet down.

504
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:29.430
McCallie’s: bow down, what? Down, boil down what I have to say, however, to a matter of wanting to express my very real sense of appreciation of your kindness and understanding during these past few months.

505
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:36.889
McCallie’s: I suppose that every mother has some serious doubts about any young man who pays court to her daughter.

506
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.960
McCallie’s: But your hospitality, sense of humor, and general understanding of my problems have made me my any.

507
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.310
McCallie’s: my my courting of Madden so much easier than it might have been

508
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.990
McCallie’s: that I can never really express my appreciation properly.

509
00:45:52.440 --> 00:46:03.189
McCallie’s: And now that an engagement is about to be announced, I know good and well, that the burden on you is just beginning to be the formidable thing that it will be until the wedding is over.

510
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:09.140
Ellen Cochrane: I also realize that about the only thing that I can do is to help is to keep quiet and keep out of the way.

511
00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.360
McCallie’s: So before. I haven't even done that very well. But I'll keep trying.

512
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:25.400
McCallie’s: Finally, I know that you are not half so interested in how much I appreciate all that you have done and will be doing for Madden and myself as you are, and what sort of a husband I'll make, Madden.

513
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:26.840
McCallie’s: I can't

514
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:42.949
McCallie’s: figure to express myself on this subject in one letter or any number of letters, but if the love, devotion, and determination to serve Madden, if those things which I feel mean what I believe into, then I know you will never have cause for concern.

515
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:50.010
McCallie’s: The Lord willing, I'm looking forward to devoting the next 40 years or so to proving this.

516
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:54.769
McCallie’s: I hope this next weekend will will give us time enough to have another talk.

517
00:46:54.980 --> 00:47:07.799
McCallie’s: so I know that must be a million things to talk of. I'm delighted to hear of the party on Saturday. I talked to Mother Mother K. Briefly last night, apparently in the hubbub. I had forgotten to write her.

518
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:35.879
McCallie’s: and she, too, is quite happy about the arrangements that you've made. I fear I fear I'll be a little overwhelmed. But just the same I'm looking forward to meeting all of the Lupton clan whom I've missed so far. Lots of love. David Ps. Tell your daughter that this is the only contribution for 1662 Hillcrest. That was their address for Friday. It's 2 am. And I have no news except that I'm more in love every day, and having a great deal of

519
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.540
McCallie’s: trouble waiting for Friday. David.

520
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.040
Helen: Oh!

521
00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:40.370
Mel Cooper: Oh!

522
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.040
Ellen Cochrane: Oh, my! Gosh!

523
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.525
McCallie’s: I love that that was that was great. Daddy.

524
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.710
Mel Cooper: That is great.

525
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.410
Zoom user: That's super super letter.

526
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.200
Zoom user: I wish I had. What written.

527
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.937
McCallie’s: Yeah, I never wrote those kind of letters.

528
00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:03.614
McCallie’s: It feels like we need a ken Burns animation while it's go while you're reading.

529
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.902
Mel Cooper: Next year. Next year that'll be on the website.

530
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.740
McCallie’s: That's that's all for me.

531
00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:21.127
McCallie’s: Oh, well, I will say how I met her she called and asked me out for a date.

532
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.490
Helen: Is that true.

533
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:35.100
McCallie’s: It is. I needed a date to a social event, and Alan had asked me out several times prior to that, but he was

534
00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:45.200
McCallie’s: then then taken, and so she called him up to get my phone number and called me.

535
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.819
Zoom user: I want to add one, and I know I shouldn't. But I'm going to.

536
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:57.899
Zoom user: I don't have the letter, but I worked very hard on the letter to the brand fest, especially

537
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.649
Zoom user: Mr. Branfast.

538
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:11.309
Zoom user: I remember going over and over and over, sending it, and then Trista called couple days later and said.

539
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:15.690
Zoom user: my father says he received a letter

540
00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.930
Zoom user: that is so wonderful, asking for my hand in marriage.

541
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.230
McCallie’s: It was unsan. Do you know who voted.

542
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.869
Zoom user: Could not believe I'd done.

543
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:31.560
Zoom user: Yeah.

544
00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:37.065
McCallie’s: One of the few times you didn't sign it.

545
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.399
McCallie’s: The only thing I didn't say.

546
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.590
Mel Cooper: Haste. Who's next?

547
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.349
Hastings Hart: Hey? We got several from.

548
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.040
Helen: Oh!

549
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:50.990
Mel Cooper: Oh, how sweet!

550
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:59.489
Mel Cooper: I'm so sorry they're not here, Paul told me. He is giving a lecture today in Atlanta on his new book.

551
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.030
Mel Cooper: so they could not be here. But how beautiful that is!

552
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:05.469
Helen: Okay, what's his new book?

553
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:12.279
Mel Cooper: Oh, I can't tell you right now, but it's something we're gonna have to have a zoom just for that.

554
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:18.699
William Pressly: We were at the wedding. That's me right there. It was a beautiful.

555
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:28.959
William Pressly: a beautiful wedding. My kind of favorite photograph of the wedding actually isn't here. It was a photograph of their wedding cake.

556
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:48.520
William Pressly: and there was a picture of our son and Jane's son putting their fingers into the cake. And it was just it was really quite hysterical. but Jane looked beautiful. I don't remember being well, that's a nice picture. Okay, yeah, so that's that's obviously, mom and dad and Bill.

557
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.570
Helen: Yeah.

558
00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:52.280
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah.

559
00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:58.220
Helen: I love Uncle Bill in his white coat, in that other picture.

560
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.529
William Pressly: White coat! What.

561
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.910
Helen: Yeah.

562
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.220
William Pressly: Oh, yeah.

563
00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.690
McCallie’s: That's snappy.

564
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.430
William Pressly: Oh, he would! Dad would love to be snappy.

565
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:07.690
Mel Cooper: Yeah.

566
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.789
William Pressly: That's the Savannah River in in the background.

567
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:23.359
Mel Cooper: And the pictures inside are in that wonderful rectory attached.

568
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:23.860
William Pressly: Correct.

569
00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.700
Mel Cooper: Search.

570
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.530
William Pressly: Right, right.

571
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:31.369
Mel Cooper: Beautiful tour of that the last time we were in Savannah with Jane.

572
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.479
Mel Cooper: And remember, Ellie, yeah.

573
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.980
William Pressly: It. It had to be reconsecrated because Sherman used that as his headquarters when he.

574
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:41.420
Mel Cooper: Yeah.

575
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:47.099
William Pressly: Hi Savannah, and brought in people there for meetings.

576
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.549
Mel Cooper: Does anyone know the year that they married.

577
00:51:51.400 --> 00:52:02.139
William Pressly: Just can't remember. I mean, David was, I mean, maybe around 19 in the 19 eighties.

578
00:52:03.088 --> 00:52:09.890
William Pressly: maybe 1980. Somehow around there, I mean, I don't think, David well, I somewhere around there, I really

579
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.129
William Pressly: I'm not sure.

580
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.240
Mel Cooper: Okay.

581
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:20.240
William Pressly: And I think they met. I I could be wrong on this, that jane

582
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:29.939
William Pressly: came to see Paul, and in his role as as headmaster at Savannah country day school to talk about her son.

583
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.270
William Pressly: So I think that's how it started.

584
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:34.672
William Pressly: Hmm! That's interesting.

585
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.420
Mel Cooper: At school. That's what I thought.

586
00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.938
William Pressly: I mean, you know she was a widow, and had

587
00:52:40.988 --> 00:52:45.469
William Pressly: lost a daughter as well in a horrible car accident.

588
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:46.370
Mel Cooper: Yes.

589
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.720
Ellen Cochrane: So did. Where? Where did they get married?

590
00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:57.280
William Pressly: In Savannah in in this church. What's the name of the Church? Well, it's the Episcopal Church.

591
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.579
Ellen Cochrane: Okay, good. I some. For some reason I have a

592
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:10.479
Ellen Cochrane: I have a memory of them in a church, and it must have been somebody else's wedding, but but her son was was also there.

593
00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:11.710
William Pressly: We'll have you.

594
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.400
Ellen Cochrane: Adult, son, so.

595
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.700
William Pressly: Well, that would have been later on then, because.

596
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.259
William Pressly: you know, in in Rob was what probably around

597
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:26.499
William Pressly: 12 or 13 when they got married. Well, there, that's Rob right there. Yeah.

598
00:53:30.107 --> 00:53:37.970
Mel Cooper: I hate to move it on, but we've got we gotta go. We gotta keep moving. So I think Wyatt's next right.

599
00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:41.065
William Pressly: You skipped us.

600
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:42.760
Mel Cooper: We're coming back. We just didn't.

601
00:53:43.115 --> 00:53:44.180
William Pressly: I saw that.

602
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.289
Mel Cooper: Please at once.

603
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:48.170
William Pressly: I think there may be a good reason.

604
00:53:49.128 --> 00:54:05.640
Wyatt & Joanie: We've already. The Wyatt Macaulay family has had a lot here, so I'll just jump to to. How we came to plan our wedding. I got back off Patrol in July of 1971

605
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.139
Wyatt & Joanie: Joni and I

606
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:17.490
Wyatt & Joanie: felt like we were engaged, but we had not announced it. I had not bought a ring. I was scheduled to start law school in 2 months.

607
00:54:18.059 --> 00:54:35.239
Wyatt & Joanie: And I just come back from a patrol where for the last 2 months I was completely underwater, literally and incommunicado, not even allowed to transmit any messages, so we were a bit in turmoil when it came to planning.

608
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:36.780
Wyatt & Joanie: and

609
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:47.279
Wyatt & Joanie: I was with Joni and and her mom and dad up in Boston in early July, and Joni and I were seriously talking about. Well.

610
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:59.710
Wyatt & Joanie: what do we do for a wedding, and you know, in those days the religious difference between us was such that I don't think either of our faiths would have

611
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.030
Wyatt & Joanie: performed a ceremony in that faith

612
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:23.620
Wyatt & Joanie: chapel or whatever. So we just really didn't know what to do. And size was a problem the size of the wedding and stuff. So anyway, that evening Joni and I went out to eat Chinese food at China Sales Restaurant, in

613
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:28.170
Wyatt & Joanie: in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and we had a

614
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:34.119
Wyatt & Joanie: a dinner, and we discussed all these problems, and we had absolutely no solution.

615
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:47.310
Wyatt & Joanie: and we paid the bill and the fortune cookies came, and we opened the fortune cookies, and you are seeing a photo underneath that picture of an

616
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:52.360
Wyatt & Joanie: the actual fortune cookie that came out that night.

617
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:52.890
David McCallie: Why should?

618
00:55:52.890 --> 00:56:00.229
Wyatt & Joanie: Short engagement and a secret marriage. Now we didn't have a secret marriage, but we did have a short one, I mean a small one.

619
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:28.150
Wyatt & Joanie: And so that's how we did it. And I'll just conclude by saying that we wanted to set the time fairly quickly in the fall and get on with it, and and so we set it for November 13, th and people have said, Well, why would you choose the 13th for your wedding? Why not a different day like, say, November 6th or November 20, th

620
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:38.880
Wyatt & Joanie: and the answer is, the Yale bulldogs had home football games on the 6th and the 20, th but not on the 13, th

621
00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:50.969
Wyatt & Joanie: and we had season tickets to all of the Yale football team games. So we decided there was no sense wasting those tickets. So we picked the 13.th

622
00:56:51.425 --> 00:56:56.119
Wyatt & Joanie: Okay, the rest is history. It's been a great one.

623
00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:06.959
Mel Cooper: Why, that's a riot, and I have never heard this story of the Chinese fortune Cookie, and Mel and I also went to a Chinese restaurant.

624
00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.260
Mel Cooper: I believe it was the night of our marriage, though.

625
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:17.929
Mel Cooper: after we had left everybody and our fortune, Cookie said, you are entering a land of sunshine.

626
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:20.825
Joanie's New iPad: And

627
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.309
Mel Cooper: What was the other thing he just said.

628
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.819
Mel Cooper: Anyway, there was something else in common, too. So, anyway, thank you.

629
00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:37.149
Joanie's New iPad: So I want to add a couple of things. The picture of Wyatt in his naval uniform

630
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:44.580
Joanie's New iPad: is taken in Seattle, Washington, and in the background very faintly. You can see Mount Rainier.

631
00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:52.539
Joanie's New iPad: and he is on his way. This is the summer of 1970 to see Eleanor in Japan.

632
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.890
Mel Cooper: Oh, no, you're kidding.

633
00:57:53.890 --> 00:58:15.240
Joanie's New iPad: Yeah, so he had to go. He was going you know, naval transport from one place to the next to the next, and it took him a few days to get over to Japan, because that was the era of the Vietnam war, and most of the the planes were heading to Vietnam, anyway. So that's 1 thing. The other thing is

634
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:32.960
Joanie's New iPad: one of the reasons that we pretty much knew we were going to be getting married once Wyatt came back from patrol in July of 71 is before he left on patrol in March or April, early April of 71.

635
00:58:33.574 --> 00:58:37.590
Joanie's New iPad: He leaves for 2 and a half month, 3 months actually total.

636
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:48.209
Joanie's New iPad: and my lease on my apartment with my really good friend Lynn Taft, was going to expire in 1st of June before I got back.

637
00:58:48.490 --> 00:59:00.390
Joanie's New iPad: so I kind of asked him if we could get married. I you know I kind of proposed to him. I said, why it? My lease runs out in the apartment. June first, st should I, renew it or not

638
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:05.140
Mel Cooper: And he looked, and he thought, and he said, I guess not.

639
00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:07.070
William Pressly: Good morning, so.

640
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.807
Joanie's New iPad: So any. So that was, yeah, anyway.

641
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:15.619
Joanie's New iPad: yeah. So I kind of proposed to him. And and it's worked out very well.

642
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:16.435
William Pressly: Yes.

643
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:18.299
Mel Cooper: I should say.

644
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.210
Helen: 3.

645
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:20.470
Joanie's New iPad: So.

646
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:32.290
Mel Cooper: And when White came to Japan after on this, after this picture, he kept talking about this girl he was so in love with, he couldn't. He just could not focus on anything in Japan.

647
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:42.283
Mel Cooper: I just kept talking, and I got so sick of hearing about this girl, who I did not know. I'm glad it was Joni.

648
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.759
Mel Cooper: Now I think we're ready for the other Presley bill. And Nancy, yeah.

649
00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:57.630
Hastings Hart: Oh!

650
00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.439
William Pressly: I think I'm gonna start with this.

651
01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:01.736
William Pressly: Oh, I can't.

652
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:02.850
Helen: You better.

653
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:08.469
William Pressly: Can we go to the the one on the wedding chapel, the 3rd one down? We'll come back to this.

654
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:12.137
William Pressly: That yeah. So we were married on

655
01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:22.250
William Pressly: July 12, th 1970. And this is a private chapel. It's the Rockefeller Chapel in the Conical Hills, as you can

656
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:25.470
William Pressly: see on on the sign, and it has a

657
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.759
William Pressly: Chagall rose window in the back

658
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:50.200
William Pressly: and Matisse windows along the side stained glass windows, which are spectacular, and it worked very well for us, since Chagall is a Jewish artist and Matisse Christian. And so it was a union, the Union Church of the 2 faiths

659
01:00:51.016 --> 01:00:58.710
William Pressly: and we had met in graduate school.

660
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.477
William Pressly: I was a

661
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:14.118
William Pressly: in the the we're both art history students. Or I should say, that's how we got into this chapel because we, Nancy, had done some cataloging for for

662
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:27.350
William Pressly: the David Rockefeller's collection, and so that gave us a an n and as art historians.

663
01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:46.629
William Pressly: We really wanted to be someplace that that was quite beautiful, and this was a wonderful setting, but I had been 2 years in graduate school at Princeton University, and my

664
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:57.880
William Pressly: the man I came to work with. My mentor advisor left and went to Nyu to the Institute of Fine Arts, which is in the Duke Mansion.

665
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.730
William Pressly: 78th East

666
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:15.930
William Pressly: Street, right by 5th Avenue, on that corner, pretty much across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So I took classes at the Institute to finish my degree.

667
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:31.130
William Pressly: and remember I had been pretty much in all male environments for a very long times, maybe worse than well, maybe not worse than being locked up in a submarine with all those men. But

668
01:02:31.629 --> 01:02:40.609
William Pressly: so I come to New York, and it was sort of like dying and going to heaven, and it's just a a whole new experience.

669
01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:53.350
William Pressly: And the 1st one of the 1st courses I enrolled in was given by the the senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art, and his name was William Rubin.

670
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.439
William Pressly: You've got to remember this is 1969,

671
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:07.110
William Pressly: and it was back in the the bad old days, and professors then sort of would go through the female student body with impunity.

672
01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:13.330
William Pressly: quite literally. And this guy was a noted rue

673
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:30.120
William Pressly: taught at Sarah Lawrence, and would go through the senior class almost every year, any rate at the Institute. In this he taught a seminar on Dada and serialism of which he was the specialist, and it was very exclusive, hard to get in.

674
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:36.480
William Pressly: so he limited it to a select few. There were 14 in the class.

675
01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:42.129
William Pressly: and 12 of them were women, and they were. I was one of 2 men.

676
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:49.790
William Pressly: and the other man, who became a very close friend, was gay. So I had this

677
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:54.860
William Pressly: a very enviable position.

678
01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:03.159
William Pressly: But Nancy was at enrolled at Columbia University and getting her degree there.

679
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:11.939
William Pressly: but she lived on East 78th Street and had a job at the met, so she would take courses at the Institute and then have the

680
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.580
William Pressly: have it transferred the credit over to to Colombia.

681
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:24.399
William Pressly: and she had taken a course the year before the Academic year before that Ruben had taught

682
01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.339
William Pressly: a lecture course, and she got the highest grade in the class.

683
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:42.749
William Pressly: and she didn't even apply for the seminar. But again he had an eye for beauty. So he contacted her and invited her to come to the seminar, so she was one of the 12 women.

684
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:50.710
William Pressly: So there we were, and I think it was about 3 weeks into the course

685
01:04:50.860 --> 01:05:02.950
William Pressly: I was in the Museum of Modern Art and Library, doing research in my paper for the course, and Nancy showed up also to to undertake

686
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:09.530
William Pressly: research for her papers, or we obviously recognized one another and started talking.

687
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.398
William Pressly: and we went down in the elevator

688
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:25.389
William Pressly: and went up 53rd Street and crossed over 55th Avenue, and I suggested we go to Scribner's, and this is back in the day when there were such a thing as bookstores

689
01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:30.269
William Pressly: so we went up the spiral

690
01:05:31.092 --> 01:05:43.149
William Pressly: staircase there in in scrimmers. And Nancy. This was also the day of of the Mini skirts, and she was wearing one very attractively.

691
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:52.390
William Pressly: and about halfway up the steps she turned around and said, you wanted to come up the steps to look up my skirt, didn't you?

692
01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:02.580
William Pressly: And she mailed me, I mean she was absolutely right, but in my defense I did not enter in the elevator on the way down from the library, so

693
01:06:03.013 --> 01:06:07.259
William Pressly: we. Still, I didn't do that, but she ended up inviting me to her

694
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:18.759
William Pressly: her apartment for dinner. No, no, no, no! I told you I had to go back to my apartment.

695
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:32.292
William Pressly: anyway. I turned around and looked him in. And he I just he smiled back at me, and he was so handsome I said, oh, what the heck! It was just just crazy.

696
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:39.060
William Pressly: So I want to go back to that picture. Can we go back to the 1st one. No, the 1st one

697
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.439
William Pressly: so mom was giving

698
01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:54.190
William Pressly: was going to give a I guess the engagement party and her theme was peach of a pear

699
01:06:55.563 --> 01:06:56.406
William Pressly: and

700
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:17.020
William Pressly: I was very, very arty in those days, so peach of a pear was like, huh! I mean, I just I couldn't wrap my round around what even that meant, and a friend of ours was taking photographs, and we just we couldn't smile. We couldn't do anything, so he went back to. He was in my apartment, went back and got. We kind of had us up.

701
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:22.350
William Pressly: I think it's a World war. 2 bombardiers

702
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:45.469
William Pressly: you all probably know better than I do, and that got us turned on with smiles and took the best photographs of our lives. This is one of the more tempered ones. We couldn't show you all of them. They were just fun, I mean, you know, we just we had such a good time, and then the very bottom one Hastings. They got a little out of order.

703
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:51.269
William Pressly: so you can see I was dating Sophia Lorett.

704
01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:53.390
William Pressly: Oh, good!

705
01:07:53.750 --> 01:08:09.599
William Pressly: There it is! So that that's after we had our good time with all of the. So that's just us. That's kind of what we look like. I had a studio apartment bill was an incredibly handsome dude.

706
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:10.560
William Pressly: and

707
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:12.770
Zoom user: Beautiful.

708
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:32.680
William Pressly: That's how we began. And you know, I think we've talked about it before, but we're both art historians, and we just we were perfectly. It's just kind of so incredible. And just sitting in that library that way together. Could you just put back the could we just see the wedding photo again.

709
01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.800
William Pressly: Sorry that we got a little out of order there.

710
01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:50.139
William Pressly: Joni. We had the kind of same issues you know. How would have you get married. My mother had this beautiful apartment overlooking the Hudson River and you know I wanted to get married there, or, quite honestly, in Central Park.

711
01:08:50.170 --> 01:09:10.949
William Pressly: and of course Mom and Dad wanted something much more formal, and I suppose respectable, and we were working for the curator of Nelson Rockefeller's collection. And she said, how about this chapel, which was a non-denominational chapel?

712
01:09:11.435 --> 01:09:21.224
William Pressly: And so it was really quite wonderful. It was not. It was a Christian service, but you know nothing over the top. And then at the end, Joanie, we we

713
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:47.669
William Pressly: They'll stepped on the glass, you know, so it's kind of nice that that's part of the tradition in a Jewish wedding that you do that. So you know, it was just kind of it was nice. It really worked out well, and then we went back. That was a beautiful setting back to New York. For the reception, and I wanted to before we go to the one where I forgot to. I don't. Can you see this? This is

714
01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:52.590
William Pressly: is this seeable by anybody? Is there any way you can capture that.

715
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:54.080
Charleigh Robinson: Closer yep.

716
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.030
Helen: Catch, what.

717
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.780
William Pressly: Say that.

718
01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.510
Charleigh Robinson: There you go!

719
01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:57.870
William Pressly: No.

720
01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:08.229
William Pressly: that's obviously me with dad. At the wedding, and it's I wish it's it's a beautiful photograph. The 2 of us look so

721
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:23.809
William Pressly: just, so incredibly happy. And it was just a very special day for me to. I lost my father, my father, a few years before, and then, you know, there, there he was, my my dad, too, with who I love with all my heart.

722
01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:27.829
William Pressly: And then the last photograph is just us.

723
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:29.000
Ellen Cochrane: Oh, okay.

724
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:41.500
William Pressly: We couldn't remember when. But there we are, you know, 40 years later, or whatever. And I think we look pretty happy. The background is Chester, just outside of Liverpool.

725
01:10:41.730 --> 01:11:07.330
William Pressly: We were there with friends, and it sort of has an Elizabethan feel, as you can see in the background. It's an Old Chester is the name for a Roman fort. So it goes back to the Roman times very cold day, and what I really remember was the hot chocolate and one of the cafes very nearby, and it was quite special.

726
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.400
William Pressly: You probably have them all whiskey, and and that's David's our son's favorite photograph of us.

727
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:23.409
Zoom user: Should be. Remember that wonderful hug she gave you, and the way she looked, no doubt about her love.

728
01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:37.670
William Pressly: Yeah. Well, it's it's be our 55th this coming July 12.th So you're all invited. Have to be a very special occasion. I do want to add.

729
01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:48.030
William Pressly: I don't have that many photographs from the wedding, but we had a pretty good Macaulay turnout if I recall at the wedding and am I right?

730
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:53.471
William Pressly: He doesn't remember anything. He could barely say I do so

731
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:54.469
Zoom user: Well.

732
01:11:54.693 --> 01:12:02.289
William Pressly: But it was nice, you know. We had both the Presley and the Macaulay family, and it was not a big wedding, but it was very nice. It was very much a family wedding.

733
01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.450
William Pressly: Well, Uncle David certainly was there.

734
01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.530
William Pressly: I think a lot of people were there. So, anyway.

735
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:15.579
William Pressly: So that's our origin story.

736
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.110
Ellen Cochrane: Wonderful.

737
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:21.560
Hastings Hart: Let's see, Eleanor's going last. So, David, are you ready to share.

738
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.370
David McCallie: Sure, if I can get this to work.

739
01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:28.750
David McCallie: Okay.

740
01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.510
William Pressly: Oh, what a lovely photograph!

741
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.310
William Pressly: It's a beautiful photo.

742
01:12:43.349 --> 01:12:45.949
David McCallie: Yeah, let's see if I can get through this.

743
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:50.300
David McCallie: It's easy. When you practice. It's hard when you do it for real

744
01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:55.989
David McCallie: so I I wanted to just share with you.

745
01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.159
David McCallie: the story of how Nancy and I met.

746
01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:11.249
David McCallie: Yeah, because I I realize that some of you

747
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.670
David McCallie: never met. Nancy never got a chance to know what a special person she was. So

748
01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:25.269
David McCallie: what I wanted to do is just sort of tell this story about us, and how we met, and.

749
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:27.969
David McCallie: you know, give you a little insight.

750
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:40.102
David McCallie: I didn't expect it to be hard to go through, so let me let me set the context of when we met.

751
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:51.009
David McCallie: It was the summer of 1980 and we were in Boston. I was in between the 4th or the 3rd and 4th year of medical school.

752
01:13:51.825 --> 01:13:53.235
David McCallie: Nancy was

753
01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:01.569
David McCallie: house, sitting on a beautiful house on the top of Beacon Hill, from for one of the Boston Brahmin families

754
01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:14.489
David McCallie: who had was associated with a private school in Cambridge, and Nancy was there that summer doing an art program. She was. She was teaching a special art program

755
01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:25.380
David McCallie: complicated reasons for how she got there. But basically she had a beautiful house on top of Beacon Hill all to herself all summer.

756
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:35.769
David McCallie: and I was studying Spanish a crash course in medical Spanish that summer, because the plan was to be that I was going to go spend a month

757
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:47.849
David McCallie: or 6 weeks in Colombia, Colombia in a rural clinic, and I didn't know any Spanish. So for the people who had signed up to do this program in this rural clinic. They gave us a

758
01:14:48.340 --> 01:15:12.099
David McCallie: crash course in Spanish. It turned out we never went because the political situation had deteriorated enough that they decided it wouldn't be safe for us to go, but nonetheless I didn't know that at the time, so I was busily trying to cram Donde. No, a doctor into my head and learn some Spanish, and this was a sunny.

759
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.670
David McCallie: beautiful early July afternoon.

760
01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:37.289
David McCallie: and I lived in Brookline, Mass. And had taken my bicycle and ridden down the Charles River to the Esplanade, which is a beautiful expanse of grass on the Boston side of the river, where people would just go and hang out on beautiful sunny days, and, you know, set up a blanket on the ground and sit in sun and read a book, and

761
01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:53.239
David McCallie: I think I had actually bicycled into a church that I would go to every now and then down downtown Boston, and was on my way home from that is my best of my memory. But anyway, I was looking for a spot where I could set up and

762
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.479
David McCallie: relax and study my Spanish book, and

763
01:15:57.110 --> 01:16:10.546
David McCallie: there was just happened to be a nice open piece of grass right next to a beautiful young woman wearing a bikini out sunning that Sunday afternoon, and I thought, well, this looks like a good spot.

764
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:11.770
Ellen Cochrane: So.

765
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:23.329
David McCallie: So I I managed to set up shop there and spread out my stuff and start reading my book, and I was not concentrating at all on the book or on Spanish, because I was trying to figure out.

766
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:32.980
David McCallie: how can I introduce myself to this person next to me and those of you who know me know that I'm introverted and nerdy and shy, and

767
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:47.975
David McCallie: the last thing on earth I knew how to do was a pickup line. So I was frantically trying to figure out something, and to my shock she stood up to leave, and I blurted out, Excuse me, do you know what time it is.

768
01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:49.250
William Pressly: Okay.

769
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.209
David McCallie: She, you know, kind of looked and

770
01:16:52.860 --> 01:17:12.629
David McCallie: looked at her watch, and told me what time it was, and she said, What are you doing. And I said, I'm studying medical Spanish, and we struck up this conversation, and we were talking, and after a while after it was comfortably sort of we had a nice little conversation going. She sort of said, You know, is your watch broken?

771
01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:17.430
David McCallie: And I realized I was wearing. I was wearing a wall.

772
01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:37.800
David McCallie: so I had to blurt out. What time is it? Because that was the only thing that that came to my mind? So we we had a lovely conversation, and and she invited me up to this apartment that was just a few blocks away from where we were on the esplanade, and, needless to say, we got to know each other

773
01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:45.929
David McCallie: really well, and kicked off a whirlwind relationship that culminated in a marriage less than a year later.

774
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.739
David McCallie: So, after this sort of overwhelming introduction on the

775
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:58.610
David McCallie: to Nancy. Then, couple of days later, I get this postcard, and

776
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:09.440
David McCallie: I immediately know what's coming. But I turn. I turn the postcard over, and here's what she said.

777
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:14.960
David McCallie: and I'll let you read it, because, it's more fun to read.

778
01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.230
Helen: It was.

779
01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:40.779
David McCallie: So this was emblematic of what would prove to be one of her favorite ways. To communicate was to send me clever postcards. If you can't read it. It says Choice a is. It was 10 past 2 t ou when I met you, or choice B. I'm not going to read the Spanish with the right accent. But Aaron las dos y des cuando contre.

780
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.448
David McCallie: choose the best sentence, choose the sentence which, to the best of your ears, rhymes.

781
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:48.650
Ellen Cochrane: So.

782
01:18:48.650 --> 01:19:05.620
David McCallie: This was how we we kicked this off, and I could have dug out a half a dozen other really clever photographs. But I'll move the story forward here. So because we don't want to run out of time. So word got back to Chattanooga somehow that I was pretty serious about this person I'd met

783
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:12.139
David McCallie: and I don't know what the story was and how it got

784
01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:16.410
David McCallie: organized on the Chattanooga side, but when word got out that I was

785
01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:27.499
David McCallie: going to bring her home to meet family for Christmas. This was the Christmas of 1980. When we arrived at the airport. There was a contingent of about 20 Macaulays.

786
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:35.769
David McCallie: with a welcome Brenda sign. Brenda was scratched out, and Nancy was penciled in underneath it.

787
01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:40.810
David McCallie: Oh, there! Jack Franklin, Eleanor, Alec Wyatt.

788
01:19:41.260 --> 01:20:10.059
David McCallie: William Liu, and John, and everyone was pretending to be a reporter. John's card there, says Channel M. Action, cam investigative reporter. I can't read the other. What the other cards say. But we get off the airplane. And there's these 20 people and guys with, you know, family with cameras and and movie cameras and everything. Here's another picture.

789
01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.982
McCallie’s: Willie Willie was the Beijing Times.

790
01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.549
William Pressly: That's you.

791
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:19.601
David McCallie: And here's Joni and

792
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:26.609
David McCallie: So much to my amazement, that Nancy was completely

793
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:35.520
David McCallie: cool with this, and after this sort of sort of the fun, and the excitement settles down a little bit. She walks up to every single person

794
01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.279
David McCallie: that was there, and names them.

795
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:45.879
David McCallie: You must be Eleanor. You must be Franklin. You must be John. She went through the whole list of everybody. There.

796
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.420
Ellen Cochrane: Oh, wow!

797
01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.330
David McCallie: Named them.

798
01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:55.559
David McCallie: which just stunned me, and only later did I find out how she did that which was that I had given her a photograph.

799
01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:20.339
David McCallie: and she had gone through and named, and this is her handwriting, and named everybody in that photograph, so that she was prepared when she got to Chattanooga to know who everybody was. So that's a probably a 19, you know, 7 late seventies Christmas photograph, and everybody is is named in her handwriting.

800
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:32.260
David McCallie: But before I finish Eleanor or Franklin, do you remember how that got organized the the meeting at the airport? Who who was behind that? I'm assuming it was one of the 2 of you.

801
01:21:32.260 --> 01:22:00.469
McCallie’s: I think it came about when the Macaulay Christmas would have been the night before she arrived after Christmas, so the whole family was out at school like we always do, and the word got out that she was coming, and I think you know who put it together and made it happen. I'm sure it was probably Eleanor and Frank like said, but it was the day after Christmas that she arrived at Level Field, and that was back in the days where you could

802
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:10.264
McCallie’s: go out to the gate and meet people as they got off the airplane. So she gets off the airplane. And you know. Here she's surrounded by all these buffoons that.

803
01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.790
Joanie's New iPad: But she

804
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:21.869
Joanie's New iPad: she was amazing. She went, played right along with it. She was not phased in the least. It it was wonderful, David, I mean she she was amazing.

805
01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.150
Zoom user: Sure.

806
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.390
Mel Cooper: When we were.

807
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:25.470
Zoom user: Jump in.

808
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:27.790
Mel Cooper: Jack is right. Oh, excuse me.

809
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:35.750
Zoom user: Well, it was Eleanor. It was you who got it together, but all of us got excited. All of us made signs.

810
01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.339
Zoom user: We were a giddy bunch when we met her out there.

811
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:43.070
Zoom user: and we were a little bit disappointed that she was not taken aback.

812
01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:58.739
Mel Cooper: The inspiration, for it was the fact that none of us could pronounce her last name. We just we all kept saying, What what's her name. What's her name? So we decided to carry that over to the Brenda. We got our 1st name mixed up.

813
01:22:58.890 --> 01:22:59.510
David McCallie: And.

814
01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:05.939
Mel Cooper: Everybody who interviewed her. We were all acting like we were reporters. We all called her different names.

815
01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.534
Mel Cooper: so that made it funnier that she knew our names.

816
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:15.050
Joanie's New iPad: Everyone's was funny was a lot of people in the airport.

817
01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:24.347
Helen: Were, you know, kind of confused, and oh, look that you know this woman's being, you know, interviewed. Who is she?

818
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:25.889
Wyatt & Joanie: That's fine!

819
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:33.460
Helen: That's that's what I remember. Everybody was treating her like a movie star like, who who is she? Famous? Why, I don't know her well.

820
01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:34.740
Wyatt & Joanie: Hey?

821
01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:35.260
Wyatt & Joanie: Today.

822
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:43.290
Wyatt & Joanie: name my, my memory as to the name was that it? Basically we were calling her Brenda Ball Breaker.

823
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:49.779
Zoom user: I never said that. I never said that.

824
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.920
Joanie's New iPad: Dude.

825
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:55.780
Helen: Didn't Madden think this was gonna be funny, or was she a little worried?

826
01:23:56.322 --> 01:24:03.917
Helen: I'm sure that she would think anything that involved social organization was good. So.

827
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:11.420
David McCallie: She was probably worried about me, and whether I was going to get the nerve to actually propose.

828
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:12.005
Ellen Cochrane: Oh!

829
01:24:12.775 --> 01:24:15.950
David McCallie: Yeah, that was a legitimate worry, because

830
01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:25.860
David McCallie: I'm incredibly reluctant to make commitment. That's just the way I am, and was sort of overwhelmed by this fast moving

831
01:24:26.423 --> 01:24:40.589
David McCallie: Force that it hit me completely on a random Sunday afternoon. But I finally did right before the trip to Chattanooga was over, proposed to her, and she accepted and so I go.

832
01:24:40.590 --> 01:25:05.049
McCallie’s: We? We remember that your brothers remember that y'all were down in the basement, and we everybody's watching their clock because you had to catch the plane, and it was like, you know, is he gonna is he gonna do this or not? He come up. He talked to Daddy and then go back downstairs. And finally, they're like getting in the car to leave to go to the airport. And it's like we're gonna get married.

833
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:22.240
David McCallie: It. It was it was a last minute decision. And so here you see another postcard from her, dated 9 January 81 or yeah, right, this would have been 81 delivered to my address in Boston, and.

834
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:26.050
William Pressly: It was 10 past 15. You asked me.

835
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.460
Helen: Oh!

836
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.119
David McCallie: Yes, sir, and here we are.

837
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:31.890
Joanie's New iPad: Oh!

838
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:42.680
David McCallie: After the ceremony on the way to the reception for a wonderful wedding reception that many of you attended from Chattanooga.

839
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.310
Mel Cooper: Right.

840
01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.165
David McCallie: So

841
01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:45.280
Ellen Cochrane: See.

842
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.920
David McCallie: Thank you for putting up with my emotions here.

843
01:25:48.920 --> 01:26:02.149
McCallie’s: You speaking of the wedding, you remember? Uncle Spence was there, and Ann was there. Lots of people were there, and we sang hambone at the wedding.

844
01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:02.810
Joanie's New iPad: Yep.

845
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:03.590
McCallie’s: And.

846
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:04.139
Ellen Cochrane: Oh, yeah.

847
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:19.900
McCallie’s: Led by Uncle Smith, and not to be outdone. And Nancy said this, she pulled out a pig trough, and the Bach Braider family had a tradition of dancing around the pig trough at a wedding and singing some song.

848
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:30.709
David McCallie: Right. Our brother Nate, older brother, Nate, led the dance around the pig trough. I never did find out what the origin of of that was.

849
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:37.509
David McCallie: But anyway, it was. You know. It's the universe gives you great gifts and

850
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:43.850
David McCallie: take some away, but make the most of it.

851
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:44.763
McCallie’s: Wonderful, wonderful.

852
01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:46.480
Mel Cooper: Wonderful.

853
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:56.890
McCallie’s: Helen. You, Helen, you were a recipient of that same treatment, my mother, I think she used to. I think she probably set it up when you came back from

854
01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:58.680
McCallie’s: one of your

855
01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:14.479
McCallie’s: years away in Europe. I felt like Mom had a group show up at the airport, and Daddy was dressed up as the Statue of Liberty, and they were, they were welcoming, welcoming Helen home, and of course.

856
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.729
Helen: It was after the Africa trip on the truck, and mother even had

857
01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:25.749
Helen: a truck from Macaulay with hay hay bales.

858
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:37.209
Helen: And yeah, Uncle par, I mean. Uncle David was Statue of Liberty, and no Uncle Sam. Aunt Madden, I think, was the Statue of Liberty.

859
01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:38.786
McCallie’s: That's it. That's right.

860
01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.450
Helen: And Daddy wore a.

861
01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.473
McCallie’s: Indian headdress.

862
01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:48.849
Helen: Freddie was there, I mean it was hysterical.

863
01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:51.389
McCallie’s: And of course Helen Exum covered it, for the newspaper.

864
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:52.030
Helen: Oh, yeah.

865
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:56.833
McCallie’s: It was. It was Sunday, social, newspaper.

866
01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:01.990
Helen: All of that I still have the newspaper things.

867
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.920
McCallie’s: I'm sure I do, too. Yeah, story about the.

868
01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.529
Ellen Cochrane: Truck with hay bales. I don't.

869
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:16.739
Ellen Cochrane: Well, because I've been on a truck for 5 months, and so the idea was, I didn't know how to behave unless I was on the back of a truck.

870
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:26.179
Helen: But we didn't in the idea we were gonna all ride on the truck back to Macaulay, but it was so cold

871
01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:34.369
Helen: we we just we couldn't do it so, and I've lost everybody. How

872
01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:36.870
Helen: do I get all the pictures back.

873
01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.740
McCallie’s: The positive sign on the image. There.

874
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:44.660
Helen: Oh, okay.

875
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:45.830
Helen: Well, no.

876
01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:48.880
McCallie’s: Up at the top. Right hit Gallery view. If you.

877
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:50.300
Ellen Cochrane: Where's.

878
01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:51.200
Jim McCallie: Still with you. Hill.

879
01:28:51.742 --> 01:28:53.910
Helen: Okay. Thank you. Huh.

880
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:54.990
Charleigh Robinson: We can see.

881
01:28:54.990 --> 01:29:00.070
Helen: You, Tanta. Don't worry all about me, Allison.

882
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:05.329
Charleigh Robinson: Well, you are, Franklin. It's always about. You are Franklin.

883
01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.949
Helen: Allison. That's what you said at the camping trip. Remember.

884
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:13.499
Zoom user: Alison. That's right. I'm glad you remember.

885
01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:14.830
McCallie’s: Is this?

886
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:15.890
Mel Cooper: Always.

887
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:19.300
Mel Cooper: Okay. Well, I shared this with y'all earlier

888
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:24.080
Mel Cooper: as a teaser to what Mel had.

889
01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.030
Ellen Cochrane: That's on your.

890
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:29.359
Mel Cooper: This was the Valentine's card that Mel gave me

891
01:29:30.249 --> 01:29:34.750
Mel Cooper: before we married, and there's a long setup to this. But

892
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:45.439
Mel Cooper: time time sparing some time here. So well, hmm!

893
01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:48.830
Zoom user: Who is the old hoes.

894
01:29:49.638 --> 01:29:56.890
Mel Cooper: Well, let me just set up the story a little bit, because I had just finished at University of Alabama in graduate school, and I was

895
01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:02.309
Mel Cooper: heading. I was not going to stay in Chattanooga, but I came back home, and I was going to go to Duke.

896
01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:16.259
Mel Cooper: and I had to send a letter over there to get a get some money. I had to get some scholarship, and I had to go, so I wanted to make a copy of the letter, went down to Macaulay school. I was staying with Mom and Dad there on Shelford Road.

897
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:31.519
Mel Cooper: went down to Macaulay School one afternoon, and Mr. James. Those of you who remember him said that I could have one copy as my heritage and my. So I went downstairs in the Colwell building to make a copy.

898
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:43.000
Mel Cooper: and Mel can pick it up from there. Well, in those long ago days the one copy machine for the whole school was just outside my office.

899
01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:55.380
Mel Cooper: and it it really irritated me a lot because we there was a woman who was supposed to be the receptionist in the outer office for

900
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.169
Mel Cooper: those of us, Henry Hennegar and me, and others, and

901
01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:06.609
Mel Cooper: Everybody stopped and talked, and it was just always interrupting things, and nobody was getting any work done. So I would.

902
01:31:06.710 --> 01:31:21.679
Mel Cooper: you know. Here comes somebody else, another one of those Macaulays using the damn copy machine. But this time it was different. Well, how is it different? Well, I heard this female laugh.

903
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.180
Mel Cooper: and I thought.

904
01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:47.240
Mel Cooper: I better go check this one out. Okay. So I got into Duke. But I didn't get any money, because Ronald Reagan had just taken over and he had canceled all the pill grants so so I couldn't go to Duke. So I said, Okay, I'll stay in Chattanooga. And I went up to Spencer and said, Hey, Spencer, I think I'm going to stay in Chattanooga, and I'd like to get into development.

905
01:31:47.370 --> 01:32:11.270
Mel Cooper: What do you recommend? He said. Oh, I recommend you go right back downstairs and talk to Mel Cooper. He's the best in the city. So I did, went back downstairs and talked to Mel Cooper. And what did he say? I said, Let's go have Chinese food. We went out to dinner. That was the beginning of our Chinese food. Okay, so time goes by a little bit, and

906
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:36.300
Mel Cooper: you know we had the usual ups and downs and offs and ons, and scared and committed, and afraid, and in love, and not in love, and all that. So by Valentine's things weren't going too well. They kind of slowed down, and there was going to be a ballet at downtown at the Tivoli, and so I decided I'd invite Mel to go to the ballet.

907
01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:46.340
Mel Cooper: so I invited them and my mother, who I was living with my parents, they said, Oh, well, mother said, why don't you invite him over for dinner before the ballet.

908
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:49.260
Mel Cooper: So I did, and if you remember, Queenie.

909
01:32:49.880 --> 01:33:16.629
Mel Cooper: there were hearts everywhere. There were hearts all over the table in the front door, in the dessert, and as we left to go to the ballet she said, Well, why don't you come back after the ballet? I'll have pecan tarts ready for you. And this was Wednesday night, and that's when she fixed them for the church social. So so we came back after the ballet, and

910
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:20.030
Mel Cooper: there were in the kitchen. Mother had

911
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:28.580
Mel Cooper: 2 pecan tarts on crystal plates with a silver fork and a folded linen napkin, and

912
01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.480
Mel Cooper: and Mel looked at that, and he said.

913
01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:48.760
Mel Cooper: do you know how to make these? And I said, I've got the recipe, and that was it. But you did make them. Yes, he bought me not too long ago about a thousand of the little tins that.

914
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.210
Joanie's New iPad: No good.

915
01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:55.720
Mel Cooper: Queenie. Would Queenie would reuse the tens till they were just crumple

916
01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:07.380
Mel Cooper: aluminum foil, you know, and and Eleanor was doing the same thing as this is ridiculous, you couldn't find them in the grocery store. So I ordered them online. We still have plenty left.

917
01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:14.749
Mel Cooper: Okay, so this was the card he gave me that valentine. So yeah.

918
01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.520
Mel Cooper: Hastings, let's see the inside. Yeah.

919
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:25.400
Mel Cooper: it's it's not necessarily the message, though

920
01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:49.819
Mel Cooper: you're not like all the others that did make me laugh. It was the love, Mel that really won my heart, I thought, oh, that's different. That's not like all the others. So in a few more months after this we were married, and so we'll go to the next picture, and many, many of you.

921
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.313
William Pressly: Love you.

922
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.150
Joanie's New iPad: Yeah.

923
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:53.369
Mel Cooper: Now

924
01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:08.609
Mel Cooper: to explain why these photographs are behind us, these paintings. This reception was held in the undercroft of Grace Episcopal Church, and they had just had an art show and had not taken them down. So

925
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:24.090
Mel Cooper: we really had such a big group that that's we sat on the stage set and stood on the stage, and you know I didn't. This picture was taken in 2 parts, and Jim just put it together for me this week, so I haven't even seen it as a whole.

926
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:25.909
Mel Cooper: But I think

927
01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:36.880
Mel Cooper: you'll see lots of people there. Uncle Bob had just died, that's maybe a year before, but other than that all our aunts and uncles are there.

928
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.919
Mel Cooper: and Mrs. Frazier, on the far left.

929
01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.470
Joanie's New iPad: Sure.

930
01:35:42.398 --> 01:35:47.820
Mel Cooper: Let's see, Becky, on the far right has her arm in a sling. Can anybody remember why.

931
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:54.060
McCallie’s: She, and Freddie and Becky's boyfriend, or

932
01:35:54.687 --> 01:36:01.450
McCallie’s: we're coming in from Charlottesville for the wedding, and they're driving in Freddie's big truck and had a wreck in Knoxville.

933
01:36:01.450 --> 01:36:01.800
Joanie's New iPad: Oh!

934
01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:16.209
McCallie’s: That afternoon of or whatever, and Becky broke her arm, and but I don't think anybody else was hurt. It was a big big truck, and but that was that day, I think, even. But it was. It was tragedy.

935
01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:23.280
Joanie's New iPad: Could have been, and Freddie's in the middle, in the back row next to Tom, right above Uncle David.

936
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.700
Joanie's New iPad: Yep.

937
01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:35.170
Mel Cooper: And Nancy is in this picture, so that proves David got married before we did. But David is not in it.

938
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:36.010
Helen: Good.

939
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.850
Ellen Cochrane: Standing behind Alan.

940
01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:39.970
Ellen Cochrane: Is that K.

941
01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.240
Mel Cooper: Yeah, yeah.

942
01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.200
William Pressly: Oh!

943
01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:44.340
Helen: Kay, and.

944
01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.520
Ellen Cochrane: But next to her.

945
01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.000
Helen: And your older sister.

946
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.890
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah, but I don't see my mother, and I don't see me.

947
01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:53.429
Ellen Cochrane: I don't think I was there.

948
01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.450
Mel Cooper: All right. Was your mother in Germany?

949
01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:00.370
Ellen Cochrane: Oh, could have been.

950
01:37:00.370 --> 01:37:02.769
Mel Cooper: And then so you were you. Could you have been with her.

951
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.800
Helen: No, I wasn't. No.

952
01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.820
Helen: Why isn't Jim in here? Because Jim flew back from Vienna. I was still in Vienna, but Jim.

953
01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.450
Joanie's New iPad: Hey? Isn't Jim? Next to Franklin.

954
01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:14.980
Helen: Far left.

955
01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.480
Helen: Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

956
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:26.429
Helen: The day of the wedding, my friends in Vienna all took me out because they were afraid I was going to be so sad.

957
01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.210
Helen: knowing I was missing this wedding.

958
01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:29.940
Joanie's New iPad: Oh!

959
01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:38.930
Helen: And I didn't know why they were all doing around, and we had a great day. And then they said, Well, did you get through the day. All right.

960
01:37:39.150 --> 01:37:42.290
Mel Cooper: Oh, oh, okay, Ellen.

961
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:46.300
Mel Cooper: Well, you see down the bottom Carrie and Keith.

962
01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.750
Mel Cooper: Oh.

963
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:48.510
William Pressly: Okay.

964
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.880
Joanie's New iPad: Yup!

965
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.809
Mel Cooper: And they were my brides flower girls. They they were all in the wedding.

966
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:54.410
Joanie's New iPad: Yeah.

967
01:37:55.370 --> 01:38:03.320
Charleigh Robinson: We we besides Uncle Tom and my parents? Obviously we were at all of our other aunts and uncles weddings. We were present, and.

968
01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:03.779
Ellen Cochrane: And it's.

969
01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.400
Mel Cooper: Great, Allison.

970
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:14.249
Charleigh Robinson: Yeah. Well, I want to allow a little time for anybody who has been inspired and hasn't had a chance to talk.

971
01:38:14.855 --> 01:38:19.200
Mel Cooper: Please. We have a little time, and I want to hear

972
01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.919
Mel Cooper: anything that's come up. Anything that's on your mind.

973
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.620
Tom 4: No.

974
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:29.760
Tom McCallie: Thing is that card that Mel gave you with the snake.

975
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:37.349
Tom McCallie: This is the year of the snake, and it's the Xi jinping is outlawed green snakes.

976
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:44.639
Tom McCallie: snakes in China. So just want you to know what's wrong with green shakes.

977
01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:52.729
Tom McCallie: Oh, the green in Chinese are a combination of the letters that make Xi jinping.

978
01:38:52.730 --> 01:38:53.800
Mel Cooper: Hey!

979
01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.010
Tom McCallie: And then the other one is within the context of their culture.

980
01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:07.577
Tom McCallie: Something bad happens to you in the year of whatever you were born in, so he's very worried. He's had to

981
01:39:08.110 --> 01:39:09.499
Tom McCallie: strokes this year.

982
01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.049
Mel Cooper: Well, it is the year of the wood snake. They they make it

983
01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.299
Mel Cooper: a big deal, saying the wood snake.

984
01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:18.320
Mel Cooper: which has been a great blessing.

985
01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.210
Tom McCallie: Green.

986
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:25.990
Ellen Cochrane: I've never heard of a wood snake. Is that really? Is that true, Eleanor? It's the year of the wood snake.

987
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.480
Mel Cooper: Right.

988
01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.579
Tom McCallie: No, it's the year of the Snake period.

989
01:39:30.953 --> 01:39:36.399
Zoom user: Are Becky and Megan still on? If they are, I'd love for them to share.

990
01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:42.993
Mel Cooper: Well, I don't think they could wait all this.

991
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:47.690
Mel Cooper: I had talked to them earlier, and they they

992
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:56.559
Mel Cooper: at the beginning of today. I I was looking at them when I said, Does anyone else want to present? And they did not. They did not nod their head, so

993
01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.680
Mel Cooper: I think they they knew they couldn't stay, or something.

994
01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:00.330
Ellen Cochrane: Oh!

995
01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:10.270
Wyatt & Joanie: Eleanor. I had a comment about the family's history of tormenting the new people that are coming into the family to get married.

996
01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:15.470
Wyatt & Joanie: and the story that I heard that started. It all involved Aunt Mary.

997
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:20.469
Wyatt & Joanie: and and when she brought Uncle Bob Ware home for the 1st time.

998
01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:28.640
Wyatt & Joanie: and I don't know if others have heard that. But basically the family actually contacted Bob in advance and said.

999
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:30.539
Wyatt & Joanie: We are going to

1000
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:50.619
Wyatt & Joanie: be kind of crazy when you get here. And so they were, and apparently I mean, like at the dinner table, one of them would say, Pass me a biscuit, and somebody would pick up a biscuit and throw it across the table. So they were. They were just doing awful things.

1001
01:40:50.690 --> 01:41:02.310
Wyatt & Joanie: and eventually I heard that Aunt Mary broke down in tears, and they had to tell her this was all a joke on her or whatever, but that that idea of

1002
01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:08.630
Wyatt & Joanie: of having the big kind of odd reception apparently goes way way back.

1003
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:17.347
Ellen Cochrane: You know why, I I remember my mother telling me a story, and I didn't know whether it was. I thought it was what what the family did

1004
01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:25.779
Ellen Cochrane: to my father when she brought him home. But it may have been she may have just combined the 2 stories, but that but the end of it was that

1005
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:30.730
Ellen Cochrane: grandfather was

1006
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:42.671
Ellen Cochrane: was laughing, and and I guess Grandmother Kay was was chastising him, so he crawls under the he says, well, I'm in the doghouse now, and he crawls under the table.

1007
01:41:44.635 --> 01:41:50.639
Ellen Cochrane: so I'm sure he got out at some point. But yeah, I just mothers.

1008
01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.100
Ellen Cochrane: Mother's stories were.

1009
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:58.839
Helen: And, Wyatt, you're exactly right about the throwing the rolls and stuff.

1010
01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:16.649
Wyatt & Joanie: And I think when they picked him up at the train station or wherever he came in, they had hay seeds in their teeth, you know they were all they, you know they they look like hay seeds, and whatever they they were awful so awful that Aunt Mary broke into tears eventually, and.

1011
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:18.977
Ellen Cochrane: I can't imagine.

1012
01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:24.986
Mel Cooper: So, Tom, the moral of that story is, don't bring anyone here.

1013
01:42:25.823 --> 01:42:26.790
Ellen Cochrane: Yeah, just.

1014
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:31.220
Charleigh Robinson: I love you are on this call. Have you been inspired.

1015
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:34.160
Tom 4: Have I inspired? What? To get married?

1016
01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.350
Charleigh Robinson: Inspired.

1017
01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.069
Tom 4: Yeah. Inspired to get married, I assume. Right?

1018
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.980
Charleigh Robinson: To never get married.

1019
01:42:40.357 --> 01:42:48.370
Tom 4: No, no, no, no, I would. I would say not never get married. But yeah, something.

1020
01:42:48.550 --> 01:43:05.470
Tom 4: because I guess there's some some examples of getting engaged, and then, 2 months later, getting married. That I feel like is very rare. I mean, that's like very fast. But I think there's a few examples where you got at least married within a year of either knowing each other or

1021
01:43:05.927 --> 01:43:08.759
Tom 4: game proposed. So I feel like that that feel like that.

1022
01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.020
Tom 4: Interesting. I mean, it's always like very quick. That's pretty cool.

1023
01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.070
William Pressly: We were.

1024
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:16.820
Tom 4: So like how quickly to do it.

1025
01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:24.320
William Pressly: We were married within 9 months. So, yeah, yeah.

1026
01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.510
Helen: Who said that, who just said that?

1027
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:28.370
William Pressly: Nancy.

1028
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.679
Helen: I don't know.

1029
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:36.139
William Pressly: And Bill did forget to ask my mother if he could marry me.

1030
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:37.000
William Pressly: You, too.

1031
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:46.660
Jim McCallie: I think, Tom, your your parents were married within, I think, 6 months. Well, she moved to the States in February, and we got married in June of 89,

1032
01:43:47.110 --> 01:43:50.691
Jim McCallie: so things can happen if you meet the right person.

1033
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:52.950
Helen: Tell them how you all met.

1034
01:43:53.650 --> 01:44:11.519
Jim McCallie: No, that's not good, but I will say I'll tell you a funny story if you don't mind, and it involves Jack Mccauley. I'm sure, when Martina and I think we were already married, and we came to our 1st Christmas, and it was at Macaulay school, and we're all sitting, you know, at those long tables.

1035
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:14.410
Jim McCallie: and we're just talking about like

1036
01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:34.719
Jim McCallie: there's a age gap, I think most people know between Martina and me that's larger than normal, let's say, and it's not 3 or 4 years. It's not 5 years. It's a little bit longer than that. And I I think Jack and Alan were asking questions. And, Jack, do you remember what I'm gonna go? Say, at all?

1037
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.220
Jim McCallie: Okay? Well.

1038
01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:40.562
McCallie’s: I can't. I can't defend myself yet.

1039
01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:56.170
Jim McCallie: I can't believe you can't remember this. It's like, because of the age gap or something. Is it like what you want to tell her. Well, you might mess it up.

1040
01:44:56.530 --> 01:45:24.100
Jim McCallie: I I don't know, I I guess. Jack. This was my very 1st Christmas in Chattanooga, and it was pretty scary. I have to say but Jack was kinda he kinda smooth, smoothed it out for me. He was really easy to talk to, and I don't know. He was just asking us a lot of questions, and like how we met, and this and that, and the other, and I don't know exactly what he asked, but my reply was.

1041
01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:43.290
Jim McCallie: well, but a time I was in kindergarten. That's when you saw me first, st or something like that, something like like what took so long. Obviously, we can't get story straight, but it's what took so long for you to, you know. Do whatever. And and Jack says, well, he had to wait till she got out of diapers.

1042
01:45:43.674 --> 01:45:52.376
Jim McCallie: You didn't say that, but anyway, I didn't scare you off.

1043
01:45:52.890 --> 01:45:55.590
Mel Cooper: How old were you, Martina, when y'all got married?

1044
01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:58.019
Jim McCallie: I just turned 22.

1045
01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:04.389
Mel Cooper: Well, you were not the youngest. Would anybody here like to volunteer your age when you got married

1046
01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:06.770
Mel Cooper: younger than Martina?

1047
01:46:06.970 --> 01:46:11.529
Mel Cooper: I'm looking at, you know Marshall and Amy got married.

1048
01:46:11.530 --> 01:46:12.310
Helen: Oh, yeah.

1049
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:15.320
Jim McCallie: Marshall was a sophomore. I'm not sure.

1050
01:46:16.530 --> 01:46:17.500
Marshall McCallie: I.

1051
01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.910
Zoom user: Motion.

1052
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:21.260
Marshall McCallie: Dad said I was 19 when we got engaged.

1053
01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:24.760
Jim McCallie: My dad said, you are not mature enough.

1054
01:46:25.330 --> 01:46:28.500
Marshall McCallie: And I said, Yes, but Amy's a year older. We'll be fine.

1055
01:46:31.835 --> 01:46:32.680
Jim McCallie: Well.

1056
01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.460
Marshall McCallie: I'm there it is gonna sound, Corny.

1057
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.289
Zoom user: Get married.

1058
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:40.180
Marshall McCallie: We actually, we actually courted on a bicycle built for.

1059
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.855
Ellen Cochrane: Oh!

1060
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.259
Marshall McCallie: I met Amy the 1st day I went to Vanderbilt.

1061
01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:49.510
Marshall McCallie: He was a year ahead of me, and I

1062
01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:53.480
Marshall McCallie: realized this was the really the right person.

1063
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:56.100
Marshall McCallie: Neither one of us had any money.

1064
01:46:56.340 --> 01:47:02.090
Marshall McCallie: but we enjoyed going out together, and so we walked up to a Western auto shop.

1065
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:07.850
Marshall McCallie: and they had a tandem bicycle for $90.

1066
01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:14.999
Marshall McCallie: That's 60 years ago. It was a lot. We put our money together and bought that 10 bicycle, and that sealed it.

1067
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.670
Ellen Cochrane: And.

1068
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:18.930
William Pressly: We're glad.

1069
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.600
Ellen Cochrane: Well.

1070
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:22.270
Zoom user: Marshall.

1071
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:26.499
Marshall McCallie: Isn't a good sport to go all over the Africa and the Middle East.

1072
01:47:28.145 --> 01:47:28.900
Mel Cooper: Absolutely.

1073
01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.510
Zoom user: Morning, Marshall.

1074
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:36.449
Zoom user: As I remember, however, you were going to get married. I think one spring

1075
01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:41.259
Zoom user: there was a mother and Dad were worried, or something.

1076
01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:44.400
Zoom user: some of us suggested. Why don't you take

1077
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:47.960
Zoom user: that trip? Do you want to go to Europe right now?

1078
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.120
Zoom user: It put it off at least a year, did it not.

1079
01:47:53.890 --> 01:47:57.260
Marshall McCallie: Yeah, I think I think they thought maybe

1080
01:47:57.410 --> 01:48:12.269
Marshall McCallie: maybe if we had that 6 month separation we would have time to examine it and think about it, and we did, and it just still looked as good as it did beforehand. So we got married when I got back from France.

1081
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:16.810
Marshall McCallie: and originally, Dad said.

1082
01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:28.679
Marshall McCallie: you guys are too young. I don't think we can come out to the wedding in Oklahoma City. Dad had checked us out very well. He had gotten come to Oklahoma City to visit my parents.

1083
01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:33.050
Marshall McCallie: and they took him, too, our church.

1084
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:36.739
Marshall McCallie: and had an appointment with Pastor Gary.

1085
01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:37.880
Helen: Can't hear her.

1086
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:39.330
Marshall McCallie: It was lovely.

1087
01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:44.709
Marshall McCallie: he, he! We had known him earlier when we lived in Oklahoma City, and then we knew him again.

1088
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:49.505
Marshall McCallie: and he talked with your dad and

1089
01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.869
Marshall McCallie: that that helped immensely, I think.

1090
01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:03.060
Marshall McCallie: well, we did have the wedding on the 25th of August, 24th of August in Oklahoma City.

1091
01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:13.009
Marshall McCallie: and mother and Dad and and Franklin, Teresa and Spencer and Sarah all drove out which we appreciated.

1092
01:49:13.410 --> 01:49:15.009
Marshall McCallie: And Helen, thank you.

1093
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:15.890
Helen: And John.

1094
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:18.270
Marshall McCallie: I don't know how you all fit in the same car.

1095
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:25.759
Helen: No, we had 2 cars, and Franklin and Teresa and Spencer and Sarah, as couples always were in different cars.

1096
01:49:25.890 --> 01:49:28.979
Helen: because they had children, small children.

1097
01:49:29.150 --> 01:49:32.879
Helen: and so if there was a wreck, they didn't want both parents.

1098
01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:35.986
Ellen Cochrane: And then

1099
01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:43.730
Marshall McCallie: The wedding was supposed to be about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and the whole family.

1100
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:50.120
Marshall McCallie: other than Amy's parents, and Amy and I went off to the Oklahoma Zoo.

1101
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:59.200
Marshall McCallie: and as the organist started playing at about 10 till 2, the

1102
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.960
Marshall McCallie: the groom's side was still empty.

1103
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:07.030
Helen: And about 2 min till 2 the groom's side was still empty.

1104
01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:10.520
Marshall McCallie: And we found out later.

1105
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:16.770
Marshall McCallie: They all came in just about 2 min after 2. We found out later. Franklin, you can

1106
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:24.969
Marshall McCallie: correct me on this Franklin and the lion at the Oklahoma Zoo had had quite a conversation.

1107
01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.189
Marshall McCallie: and they really had a hard time breaking away.

1108
01:50:28.710 --> 01:50:29.690
Marshall McCallie: Is that true?

1109
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:37.170
Zoom user: It was a. It was a tiger. It was a huge tiger in the Oklahoma Zoo.

1110
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:40.169
Zoom user: and it was at the back of the cage.

1111
01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:44.039
Zoom user: and, thank goodness, there were 2 2 fences.

1112
01:50:44.730 --> 01:50:48.649
Zoom user: one in front of the other. There was a fence in front of the cage.

1113
01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:54.269
Zoom user: I've forgotten who got got enthralled with that tiger.

1114
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:55.160
Helen: You did.

1115
01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:00.130
Zoom user: But well, I know that, Tanta, but I wasn't gonna tell him.

1116
01:51:00.810 --> 01:51:04.040
Zoom user: But anyway, so I got enthralled with the tiger.

1117
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:11.440
Zoom user: and I was making faces at the tiger, and there were little people around making fun. And all of a sudden

1118
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:22.080
Zoom user: that Tiger sprang from 10 or 12 feet back in the cage to the bar and scared the

1119
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.899
Zoom user: out of all of us.

1120
01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:31.650
Zoom user: Iran, I mean everybody there ran now there are 2 barred fences there.

1121
01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:35.379
Zoom user: and we all ran like it was coming out.

1122
01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:40.540
Zoom user: It was so. That's what took us so long before we got to the wedding.

1123
01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:41.680
McCallie’s: Yeah.

1124
01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.800
Zoom user: Were talking to a tiger Marshal.

1125
01:51:44.535 --> 01:51:48.239
Marshall McCallie: Alright, there's an there is an interesting family part of this.

1126
01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:53.329
Marshall McCallie: All our family, or much of our family, have been involved in education.

1127
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:58.950
Marshall McCallie: and I think they were very much surprised when they started talking to Amy's mother

1128
01:51:59.110 --> 01:52:05.640
Marshall McCallie: and father to realize that his father had been superintendent of schools in Oklahoma City.

1129
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:09.650
Marshall McCallie: and we were hosted to dinner

1130
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:15.719
Marshall McCallie: by Amy's uncle, who was a college president of the Oklahoma Women's College.

1131
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:21.570
Marshall McCallie: So I think they found that there was very much more in common than they had originally expected.

1132
01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:28.300
Marshall McCallie: There was one aspect, though, that was funny, because I think we may have misled by the day.

1133
01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:30.220
Marshall McCallie: Okay?

1134
01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:39.570
Marshall McCallie: Well, oh, I don't think we're if it's a bit not reception. Yeah, no, we hadn't misled them.

1135
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:41.310
Marshall McCallie: We had been.

1136
01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:44.359
Marshall McCallie: I had been unaware because I had only

1137
01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:49.459
Marshall McCallie: Marshall and I had visited. He had come to Oklahoma City.

1138
01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:50.696
Marshall McCallie: I had,

1139
01:52:51.650 --> 01:52:58.420
Marshall McCallie: While he was in France. I had gone for Helen's graduation to Chattanooga.

1140
01:52:58.630 --> 01:52:59.960
McCallie’s: And admit.

1141
01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:08.520
Marshall McCallie: And had gone Christmas before graduation and met a large number of of family. This is typical of huge

1142
01:53:09.230 --> 01:53:13.700
Marshall McCallie: there, and the same thing for her graduation.

1143
01:53:13.890 --> 01:53:16.580
Marshall McCallie: And then we

1144
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:23.339
Marshall McCallie: We had the ceremony.

1145
01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:29.529
Marshall McCallie: Yeah, since it was in Oklahoma City, and a long way from Chattanooga. And

1146
01:53:29.730 --> 01:53:38.480
Marshall McCallie: Vanderbilt was starting very soon after that, like 3 days after, was orientation for undergraduates, and

1147
01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:42.830
Marshall McCallie: so we had to get back, and that

1148
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:47.349
Marshall McCallie: night, after the well afternoon after the ceremony.

1149
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:53.290
Marshall McCallie: We went back to the house, and mother and Dad had a reception, and then

1150
01:53:53.720 --> 01:54:02.119
Marshall McCallie: they were all going to stay and have dinner, and we were getting in the car and coming because we had to make it halfway back to Chattanooga, Oklahoma City. It was

1151
01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:05.270
Marshall McCallie: slower then than it wasn't, and

1152
01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.659
Marshall McCallie: Mother had asked me several questions

1153
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:13.349
Marshall McCallie: about what people like to eat and what what they're getting wrong.

1154
01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:21.680
Marshall McCallie: and she was had was thinking of ordering champagne and having something else there.

1155
01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:28.990
Marshall McCallie: and I said, You know, she said, Well, will they do that? And I said, You know I've I've not ever seen any of them drink.

1156
01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:35.449
Marshall McCallie: and I'm I'm I'm pretty sure, from what I've heard, that they don't really do that much.

1157
01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:41.350
Marshall McCallie: So yes, have a you know, have a bottle or 2, but then have of

1158
01:54:41.890 --> 01:54:44.399
Marshall McCallie: soft drinks or other things.

1159
01:54:44.730 --> 01:54:48.125
Marshall McCallie: And so so she did, and

1160
01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:55.670
Marshall McCallie: When everybody got there we were having walking around sort of a reception. Before we left

1161
01:54:57.970 --> 01:55:01.329
Marshall McCallie: we had said to the people that were going to carry a tray around.

1162
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:08.799
Marshall McCallie: put the alcoholic drinks back on this side because you won't have many takers, and it'll make it easier for people

1163
01:55:09.110 --> 01:55:12.150
Marshall McCallie: to pick up their soft drink on that side.

1164
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:24.835
Marshall McCallie: And we started recent some giggles from the people that were helping past the drinks and

1165
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.990
Marshall McCallie: Then we didn't really know what that was about. The next morning when we called.

1166
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:41.460
Marshall McCallie: No, I think we had stopped in China. I don't know where we stopped. We called mother and Dad to say Thank you very much for the wedding, for the reception, or on our way halfway there.

1167
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:44.899
Marshall McCallie: and she said, I have have one question to ask.

1168
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:51.269
Marshall McCallie: We ran out of alcohol, she said. Everybody who

1169
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:55.390
Marshall McCallie: that came up, they would say, No, no! What's in these glasses?

1170
01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.570
Marshall McCallie: And people would say, the server would say, this is water or sprite, or whatever.

1171
01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:11.870
Marshall McCallie: and their hand would work around to the back. And so the champagne went really, really quickly, and

1172
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:25.099
Marshall McCallie: was was totally empty. Well, before the reception part it was over, which was fine. I just hadn't been around people enough to know didn't think to ask Marshall.

1173
01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:27.680
Helen: Grandmother Scanlan. She drank it all.

1174
01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:35.059
Marshall McCallie: No, no, it wasn't no, we just we just people here that did, but that's all.

1175
01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:38.680
Marshall McCallie: No it was fun.

1176
01:56:39.370 --> 01:56:44.806
Marshall McCallie: I still remember, though early on in our courtship, riding down to

1177
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:53.900
Marshall McCallie: to the center of Nashville on that bicycle for 2 to listen to. Linda Johnson. Give a campaign speech.

1178
01:56:54.640 --> 01:57:00.879
Marshall McCallie: Well, that gives you a sense of the how long ago it was we got married in 1965.

1179
01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:03.340
Mel Cooper: 1965 wow.

1180
01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.189
Marshall McCallie: Eleanor, thank you for doing this, getting us all together.

1181
01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:14.460
Mel Cooper: Well, these were great stories, and just a ton of fun

1182
01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:21.589
Mel Cooper: next time is going to be also a lot of fun. We're going to talk about our parents, and

1183
01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:40.070
Mel Cooper: that what they call the greatest generation. And photos are welcome, and you don't have to talk just about your your own parents. You might want to talk about your aunt and uncle. There's also good stories that way. So and just anything goes just

1184
01:57:40.600 --> 01:58:01.959
Mel Cooper: funny pictures, funny comments, serious stories, you know, or what you what you remember and what you appreciate. So I think we'll have a really great time with that. So look forward to seeing you then. But remember, it's gonna be March 23.rd I did change that date from the original because because of Spence, I mean Sumner's availability with the with the link.

1188
01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:21.979
Tom 4: Yeah, I just had 1 1 question before we all left, who who knew each other the longest before getting married.

Mel Cooper: Okay, anyone have something less than 15 years and but more.

1198
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:11.510
Charleigh Robinson: Well, Tom, you feel like you have a little more time.

1199
01:59:11.817 --> 01:59:18.722
Tom 4: That was super helpful. No, I feel like that doesn't count because they they knew each other such at such a early age. It's

1200
01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:19.690
Tom 4: It's a little.

1201
01:59:21.930 --> 01:59:24.190
Tom 4: It's sweeter, you know. It's sweeter. It's different.

02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:09.829

1218
02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:20.070
Ellen Cochrane: I I didn't. I couldn't find it. I kept waiting to get the recording, and and I couldn't find it. And I really, Spencer, talked about all these family names that I've heard.

1219
02:00:20.730 --> 02:00:26.410
Ellen Cochrane: you know, but I didn't have. I didn't have faces, and I didn't have really a context.

1220
02:00:26.410 --> 02:00:26.880
Hastings Hart: Yeah. Thanks.

1221
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.285
Ellen Cochrane: So

1222
02:00:27.690 --> 02:00:30.690
Hastings Hart: David has stitched that together, I believe right.

1223
02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:37.169
David McCallie: Yeah, I I can send out a link to the recording. We we had to piece 2 of them together so.

1224
02:00:38.610 --> 02:00:43.850
David McCallie: and we have a transcript that Doug and Spencer are in the process of

1225
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:48.180
David McCallie: editing. So at some point we'll actually have the written

1226
02:00:48.715 --> 02:00:59.029
David McCallie: representation. But there were some transcription errors that they were gonna correct. But I can. I can put a link out to the video itself, which is.

1227
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.520
Ellen Cochrane: Excellent.

1228
02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:02.739
David McCallie: Just the screen with all the faces, but you can hear it all.

1229
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:04.589

1232
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:15.860
Mel Cooper: Yeah. Who will? Who will do that?

1233
02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:37.499
McCallie’s: I I just got a text from Ellis saying that Douglas was with him, and I texted Douglas to see if he would give me an update. But I didn't get a response. So let me I will encourage that family. That'll be. Let me let them do that, but I'll mention it to them just it's not my not my role, but

1234
02:01:39.053 --> 02:01:49.889
McCallie’s: and and Helen or Franklin, maybe. Let me. Maybe let me ask you all to make sure that Kathy or Douglas just keeps us posted.

1235
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:53.499
Helen: Okay, I'll text Kathy. Now.

1236
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.710
McCallie’s: She's she's at home asleep, says Ellis. So oh, and

1237
02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:08.330
McCallie’s: and Douglas is at the hospital. So that's what Doug Ellis just texted me that. And I texted Doug to give me an update. But I didn't get a response yet. So that's the where we are.

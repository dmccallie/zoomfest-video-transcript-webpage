          Eleanor: Uh, all right, so that that's what's coming up, but today we have um Spencer and Doug, and before I turn it over to Doug, uh, I just wanna say to the rest of you that after today's, uh, program you might have some ideas of a program you'd like to see or that you might wanna give, um, so just keep note of that and contact me. I wish I would love to hear your ideas, so, uh, this is, this is growing in all the time, so let me know. All right, with that, Doug, I will turn it over to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="timestamp" data-time="47.0">[00:47]</span>
          Doug: Thank you, Eleanor. Hello, everybody. Um, I think the idea here is to get the oldest member of this generation to recount to us stories and memories that he had that may be unique, uh, to him, uh, since he was around when people like his, uh, his grandfather, professor, were still around. He does have some memories of, of him. Um, Now, as, as you all know, sometimes it's difficult to get dad to talk. So if we could just encourage him to overcome his um You know, almost incapacitating shyness.

        <p>
          <span class="timestamp" data-time="92.239">[01:32]</span>
          Doug: And be his emotional support without judgment in the effort to try to get him to open up, I think that would make everything work nicely. Uh, we've all heard stories about some of the more colorful, colorful members of our family, and I often get dad to tell these stories, uh. I, I forget the details, so it's a good thing that we're gonna get it on, on record here. Um, we've all seen photos of relatives and we, we know about them, but, uh, obviously a photo is a two-dimensional image and it's hard to tell what a person was like just from looking at a photo. So some of the stories I'd like to ask dad or remind dad of aren't exactly stories as Eleanor mentioned, but just anecdotes about particular people that Give a sense of, of what they were like and what their personalities were like. Um, you know, knowing that a man can jump onto the stage at the McAuley Chapel from a flat-footed stance helps us understand what kind of person that was. And you know, hearing about toes being shot off is mostly just fun. Um, toes being chopped off is also, uh, hilarious. There's skipping school and riding mules, there's basement, speakeasies in the Ku Klux Klan, there's pranks in New York elevators and wild dog attacks in Siberia. Uh, so I, I'd like to start by asking Dad to give us some context about his own life as a child. And what it was like to grow up uh on the McCallie campus in the late 1800s.
        </p>

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="193.74">[03:13]</span>
          Spencer III: We're, we're starting on the wrong foot already. It's fine, uh. This was not my idea, and so I, I hope I won't, uh, bore you with, with tales that I've already told before many times. That's pretty, uh, obvious, and I'm not the one that knows them all. I've had lunch not too long ago and uh cousin Tom uh had remembered some stories very clearly about Uncle Ed that I had forgotten. So they're gonna be other people who will want to uh get involved in this later. But today, fact checking is not allowed. Uh, this is gonna be what I remember for, for good or for bad. And uh, as I remember those days growing up on McCallie campus. Uh, Uncle Park and grandfather would walk through that campus like kings, uh. It was theirs, and you knew when they went through just as a kid that that these were the people, the two men that ruled the earth. Uh, and it didn't occur to you that it was funny. You still had two mules on the campus and a barn, and they were raising corn and okra and tomatoes, and they even got some of them in the school dining room. I think the rest were eaten by the Mr. Potts, who was raising them. But when I look back on my childhood. The men didn't pay too much attention to us and unfortunately, we tell the stories and it's always the men in the family, Uncle Park, Uncle Ed, grandfather. They weren't the ones that I remember from childhood particularly. It was the women who paid attention to us, and I found the picture that to me is just Stunning with the powerful women in it. Hasting, will you put that up, please? The first one.

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="323.76">[05:23]</span>
          Spencer III: There That was an amazing group to me. There's Aunt Augusta on the left who would charm us all in the carrier house with her apartment, and we would go in there and Aunt Augusta was famous for making uh daiquiris that were quite strong. And it, it did kind of enliven the group before we moved into the carrier part of the house. The next person is Ann Hatton. Uh, Uncle Park's wife, and she was always a presence at First Presbyterian Church. She ran a missionary a closet, and some people say, uh, that's where she got her clothes. Uh, my mother once said that Aunt Hattie was the plainest. Woman, she ever saw said she was sweet, she didn't use makeup, she was just very, very plain. And grandmother Kay, listening to that said to Mother, you know, Becky, I think that was the influence of Uncle Park. He was so conservative and had such a Uh, a narrow view of some things, said Aunt Hattie was actually had been before the marriage, a great concert pianist. And she had played on in concert stages around America and so even in Europe. She had great uh stage presence, a lot of personality, and played with passion. And when my father came home that day, Mo said, Why in the world didn't you tell me that Aunt Hattie had been a great concert pianist. And he said, now who are you talking about? She said, Aunt Hay. So where did you get that from your mother, your mother and grandmother Kay. She said, he said. That is the most preposterous thing I ever heard, and you two should not have coffee together again. The next one over is. Mamie bright, and we were told to call her Aunt Mamie. She was the head of Bright school. She had founded it. Next to her is Aunt Margaret Ellen. Those two in the summers would take courses at Columbia, at Chicago. They went to Europe together about 77 summers, something like that. They had met while they were uh both employed by GPS and Aunt Margaret Ellen was living in a Apartment or just a room in the attic of the building. Those two had a great impact on me, and part of it was. The school and reading. And Ellen was a marvelous 6th grade teacher and said herself that when she first began to teach, she talked over the kids, but by the time I got there. She was very supportive and kind and funny. And uh we we just loved her. A story about her is when she was at Barry College teaching, she had the the young farm girls basically. And she decided that she would read some good literature to, so on a Saturday, she began to read Jane Eyre. She was known as a great reader. She read the whole book. That Saturday. And they were, they were amazed, these young girls were amazed. The next morning, they came to her little apartment and said our parents are here. And they want you to hear you read the book. They want the story. So that day, she told us she read the whole novel all day long for the 2nd time, and said that she could hardly speak for 3 weeks. So that's really 4 bright women there that I remember. Very, very well. The man, his uncle John Fletcher. Anybody remember him? How many remember who he was? He's the brother Of our Grandmother My, my true blood grand. Alice Fletcher McCallie. And because of his love for her, he stayed very close to the, to the family for the rest of his life. And so he and Aunt Augusta had uh the, the McAuley family, uh, for, for many very nice dinners, and I remember him very well. I remember his right before our wedding, he presented us something that Alice had painted as a, as a young woman before the wedding, and he gave it to us with tears in his heart. Uh, a sweet, lovely man. Go to the next one.

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="628.049">[10:28]</span>
          Spencer III: right. This one is somebody left out of that other, and that is Aunt Eulajarnigan who's seated in the chair. She was one of the founders of GPS. And she was one of the ladies that along with Aunt Mamie and Aunt Ellen would ask this little boy. What he had been reading for the summer. It was kind of intimidating. But she asked what I thought about it. Did I like it? Did I remember the story? What were the, what were the main things that I remembered? And in that uh picture, I think she has already lost some of her eyesight. She ended up in her life, she was blind and kept her mind fresh by getting those heavy boxes from the Library of Congress in which people were reading uh Shakespearean plays and everything else, and that's how She held on to her intellectual and artistic life, even as an old blind woman. Uh, I don't know who the woman in the middle is, but you can see, uh, by Aunt Hattie, Bob McCallie, and then passed him, uh, David McCallie, and so the David McCallie families, I assume this is your house. Yeah, OK. And so that's where this was taken. I don't know whether it was for one of your weddings or what, but this is a, a great coming together of some great ladies. And then the next one, who,

          Spencer III: That's Aunt Hattie, and over the, the far left here is uh Aunt Beth, I think Betsy, Bob's wife. OK. Thank you. Yeah, and then the next one I have is Grandmother Kay in it with my second.

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="835.229">[13:55]</span>
          Spencer III: go to the uh yeah that one. And that is my mother and grandmother Kay. Grandmother Kay who came into this family that already had 5 kids in it. And uh she, her only preparation for life was Moody Bible Institute. My mother said that Grandmother Kay knew less about men than any woman she ever met, so she, she did not understand men, but she was funny, and she is the one that started, according to my mother, she is the one that got everybody together for the Christmas dinners and She really pushed it there. That was her thing of keeping the family together and it was expected that you should come and a lot of people would come in to town for those, and mother gave her a great credit. She is also one of those women that would ask me. What I had been reading, and not only that, because she was Macaulay librarian, she would bring me books. It was a little frightening. That meant I had to read the doggone book, and I had to understand something about it because I would be questioned, but she was marvelous in her role as a young woman with very little experience in life. Coming and marrying an older man that had just lost his wife and taking care of 5 kids. Who were not always easy. Aunt Mary didn't like the way things were going, and I think she went to Indianapolis for a while to live with another, with other relatives, and then decided that she uh needed to come back with with her siblings, and so she did, but this was a remarkable, a remarkable woman. And
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="timestamp" data-time="947.01">[15:47]</span>
          Doug: that you, you also, uh, pointed out that she had a sense of humor in joking with your mom. There's a, there's another story about elevator or something in New York, yeah,
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="timestamp" data-time="956.969">[15:56]</span>
          Spencer III: yeah, um. We heard this one. Grandfather did like pretty women, and so he was in an elevator in New York City and there was a young beautiful woman standing in front of him. They were coming down and Grandmother Kay was next to him. He was staring at her. He just couldn't get his eyes off of her, so the elevator gets to the bottom floor, door opens. She takes one step and turns around and slaps grandfather. And Grandmother Kay begins to laugh. She had pinched the young woman in the bottle. And, and everybody they thought it was his grandfather, you know, she had a good sense of her, I can't remember many more stories at this point, but that was one of the best. Another another picture. This is Alice Fletcher McCallie and Sarah and I have her portrait. This was a wedding present from Ava Wright, who was a local artist and a friend of the family. And so Sarah and I have this. In our living room, uh, at one point I made copies and gave to members of her of her children to and I know Aunt Ellen, uh, Cochran McCallie or Macaulay Cochran liked it a lot. Anyway, I don't know whether anybody wants to save that picture or get another picture, but she is the one who died in the flu epidemic of 1918 and never saw any of us coming. Didn't see her own children. Uh, grow into adulthood, marry and have children. Missed it all, uh, a lovely young woman in this picture. And I think Eleanor has some other pictures she slipped in here, would you put them in place. Famous picture. I have no idea who all these people are. It is just Enormous. Uh, And I don't know my grandfather who's in the back, the very back with a mustache. Uh, it, it looks, looks like one of the Russian revolutionaries. I don't know who he is. And on his left is Uncle Ed McCallie, and they just put into the picture by Uncle Ed side view of, I think Aunt Eula. And the small man to the very right of the picture on their left, I think that's Douglas McCallie. When we named Our son Douglas Douglas, that morning I got a call. From Grandmother Kay, who said, Spencer, you cannot name your little boy after Uncle Douglas. And I said, but I don't know anything about an uncle Douglas. And she said, well, you don't need to know anything except that you cannot use that name for your son. Uh, and I said, well, since I don't know him, it's gonna be Douglas, and so he will be Douglas McCall. Later I heard different stories about Douglas and I think some of them were unfair. Uh, others were confused. A lot more has been learned in the last year or two, and someday maybe Tom and Eleanor, who know a lot more about that now, and tell this the story of Douglas McCallie in in Korea as a missionary, and then Douglas, something went wrong and he came back. Uh, I think you have another picture. On there, yeah.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="timestamp" data-time="1209.189">[20:09]</span>
          Eleanor: Uh, let me interrupt just a minute. If we do get cut off, I've already sent you the link, Hastings, just to um If you'll send it again, and then all of you just go back to your email, look at Hastings new message, and click on it, and we'll resume.

        <p>
          <span class="timestamp" data-time="1225.459">[20:25]</span>

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="1233.5">[20:33]</span>
          Spencer III: OK. And that is the last picture taken of grandfather, Spencer Jarnigan McCallie Senior. He has leukemia. He will only live a few, a month or so beyond this point. He wanted to teach Bible to one of his own grandsons, so I'm sitting there to to his right, the left of the picture. And then there are other, all the other boys are sons of alumni. The tall one behind him is Arthur Burns, whose son is now headmaster of McCallie, and the far, uh, to the, to his far left our far right is Richard Park, who, uh, is still alive and lives, lives in Chattanooga, but grandfather uh kept teaching. This energetic man who used to be able to jump to a tabletop. Who told his fascinating stories and made them, brought them up to date. Jonathan, when the sun isn't going down and, and God has delayed, has lengthened the day so that Israel likes can win, looks at his wristwatch and says, my goodness, I thought it was 4 o'clock, but it's not. Uh, Lot's wife. Uh, turns to stone when she looks back because she had planned to go to the Sodom and Gomorrah Country. This picture looks great, but there was something happening here that made my father very, very sad. This was a very energetic teacher who could jump up on table tops and was funny and said funny things, and as he tried to teach that those last months for the first grandson that he had in in the class, 7th grade. He would have to be seated, and they brought everybody in the whole class instead of individual classes, so we were not close to him, spread out in the old dining hall. And he Uh, couldn't keep our attention. We were just kids and he didn't have that energy and he couldn't keep. And Dad tried to, we got, tried to go and stand behind him and he, it made him too sad. So Uncle Bill Presley stood behind grandfather and would point to boys who were not paying attention and acting up. And for my father, uh, this was a very sad moment to see one of the greatest, most active teachers he'd ever seen, uh, and who You know, kept the attention of children by his energy and antics, and there he was going into the twilight, uh, and couldn't hold the attention of, of, of these boys for the first time in his life, I guess. Anyway, that's

And a funny story that's funny uh a little bit is that when mother came to visit though, and everybody was in their prime, Uncle Park and grandfather. And she did her first visit and they were just morose. They were, nobody smiled, everybody just was sad and they kind of moping around and she just, she's thought this has got to be the saddest, sourest family I ever saw. I just, I don't know what. What's wrong with these people? And the right answer is. They just lost the Baylor football game. And to her, that was not reason enough.

          Spencer III: Well, actually, I don't know whether he is out there. He may have been with uh Uncle Park, but I don't think that he was a particularly dutiful student, and so they heard that new cars were coming in, that the new Pullmans or something like that were gonna be on the. On the trains coming through, and he and one of the brothers decided to skip school entirely and they somehow got all the way out to where the airport is. That was Chickamauga Station to see the new. Cars coming in, but before that they'd all been wood, so I think these were the first metal uh cars on a railroad. And they were watching it was something. It was streamlined and modern and uh it was impressive, and a man behind them said. Very impressive, aren't they? And they turned and it was their father, TH McCallie come out to see the cars to apparently he didn't do anything uh to him. Uh, but I think grandfather may have skipped school more than once, and one of his stories was that if a boy skipped school in Red Bank and another one skipped school in Say Daisy, they would run into each other by lunchtime. Somehow miraculous.

          Spencer III: Yeah, yeah, Uncle Park was a many splendored thing, really. He was known for being a uh fundamentalist. People thought he was very stern. But there was another side to him totally that was really wonderful and one time when Uh, and I'm glad you've been introduced to some of the other characters. One time when we were in the bright school it was about 2 in the afternoon I heard because at my my classrooms right across from Aunt Mamie's office, we heard arguing going on in the hallway and it was Aunt Mamie and Uncle Park. And she is saying, Park, you will not take these boys out of school during school time. And he said, Mimi, I will spend this time with my boys, and I will take them out of school. Please have them brought to me, she said, Park, we don't do this. He said, Mamie, we will do this. So there was a knock on the door, and while there were others in the classes had their mouths wide open, uh, somebody whispered, Miss Lion whispered to the teacher that was Harris at the time. And she said, Spencer, and get your things, apparently you're leaving. And I went out in the hall and Jim showed up and Franklin showed up and Uncle Park took us to Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus an hour before the circus sideshows he paid for us to give peanuts to the elephants. I still remember the, the kind of the slime on my fingers from feeding these Indian elephants. It was wonderful. We went through everything and some of it for him was a little shocking and at one point where we'd already paid to see something. They wanted 15 cents more per person, and he said, well, This is a frost. And we are leaving. So he started walking out and there are other people looked around and they follow. And one little boy said to his mother, Why are we leaving? And she said, Well, you heard the man. This is the frost. Now none of us knew what a frost was and no idea what a frost was, but we left and half the crowd, uh, left with it when we go to the surface. Actually, he had gotten us seats on the front row center ring. It was terrific and we were just amazed the whole time and here along the side. Comes the most famous American clown that ever was, Emmett Kelly, not Emmett Kelly Junior, the real Emmett Kelly, the sad sack Emmett Kelly. And he had a cabbage in his hand. And he's pulling pieces of the cabbage off and eating. And he looks at Franklin, who's looking at him with mouth wide open, right there above him, and Emmett Kelly pulls off a piece of cabbage and gives it to Franklin. Uncle Park says, don't eat that, don't eat that, Franklin. Franklin takes that cabbage and puts it in and starts all around. The crowd is laughing and applauding and Emmett and Franklin just look at each other for at least half a minute and then the great Emmett Kelly walks on. He didn't pay any attention to anybody else in that crowd, personal attention, except for Franklin. And I don't know what it was, uh, but Franklin got his attention, so that's, that's a great memory. That explains a lot. That's nice.

          Spencer III: when Orson Welles did that thing on the radio about uh or the Martians invading New Jersey and how awful it was and there were boys who were listening and they hadn't heard the intro to the program, so people thought it was a newscast. And dad had boys come and say, Don't Spence, you got to hear this. You just have to have to hear this and boy he listened to it and it was terrible. Uh, the Martians are spreading across the New Jersey flatlands and they're they're just killing people, vaporizing them, it's terrible. So Dad goes up immediately to ask Uncle Park what should be done about this, and Uncle Park says, well, don't tell me about this as well as Martians and they're all Uncle Park says that's highly unlikely. He says, uh, Marsha, Mars right now is in the orbit as far uh from Earth as it can get. I just don't think that would be, uh, you know, feasible. And he was right. It was, it was nothing, but, uh, Uncle Park had that coolness. He hadn't, he never used slang. He never cussed. So one of the things I heard him say, and I mentioned it to trustees, and they would later pick it up. If if Martians had landed on the football field, and we're all singing. Holy whatever we would say and cussing him, Uncle Park would have said. I am amazed. That's what he would have said. So several times I, I remember telling the board that and several times something would happen. There was just a wild story, and I had to explain it away and some trustee would say. I am amazed. That's one of the things I, I remember about him. O L Schmidt told me one time that a boy came to him very upset. He was afraid his girlfriend was pregnant and he was shamed and frightened and just horrified and L Schmidt never handled big problems on his own, so he went straight to Uncle Park. And I thought, listen to the story. I don't know how that's going. Uncle Park contacted the family, met with them, met with the family of the boy and the girl. Turned out she was not pregnant. And said he was so kind to everybody that it all ended, uh. In a way you wouldn't have expected. He was, uh, he never got angry, he never judged and it wasn't the uncle part that I would have feared in that situation, very, uh, a very different. Person, you know, he, uh. There were issues. He did become more and more. Conservative, he became a member of the Burke, John Burke Society. He wanted so much to have Christ return that he became very fundamentalistic and narrow and everything became a sign, everything became a sign and the most uh I guess Dramatic was, I was there I I I think I was a student. I don't think it happened when I was a teacher. He talked about the the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization treaty. And he said, boys. This is the bringing together again. Of the Holy Roman Empire. The day is nigh. The day is not. I was terrified and went back to class and the teachers are still talking about exams. homework and totally unaffected. So obviously, uh dad at some point had to say his uncle Park. Got more and more into this and more confused. That uh Did he really had to back off and, and he did the John Burke Society meetings went away and some other things like that. Later when Uncle Park looked like his body would never give out. I remember David, uh, who was his doctor, saying, well, you know, he never smoked, he never drank. Uh, and he always exercised to some extent, so his body was always in, it was always fit. It just, he was not carrying the same brain and personality, uh, that he had before. We do have some funny stories about him. Oh, by the way, he was so much into this that he went. On several occasions to the this goat's trial in Dayton. And he heard Clarence Dara and William Jennings Bryan debate each other. Uh, he was very serious about that. The mention of evolution would get him very uh. Upset and stiff, he didn't want want anybody to think that. That there was anything different in reality than what was said in Genesis, that was it, he refused to acknowledge any other possibility. He was a non-drinker. So, uh, we were I was always interested to see how. How things went at Aunt Augustus. With her because she put a lot of sauce in those daiquiris. They had been on a trip somewhere and Uncle John would say, uh, now we uh we had daiquiris in uh Hong Kong, most refreshing, most refreshing. So, uh, we thought they were most refreshing too. So we were at her house or in her apartment. And I'm sitting with Aunt Ellen and my father. The 3 of us and all 3 of us are drinking. The daiquiris, and we look and Aunt Augusta is making a daiquiri just for Uncle Park. And it has no sauce. It is, it is no gin or vodka or whatever she's putting in rum me. And we were enjoying it very much and we're getting a little buzz on. You could, everybody was getting a little buzz. This is strong stuff. Uncle Park was asked to say the blessing. And uh He did and it was sweet and lovely. Talked about made us all just seem like we were the nicest people in the world and west sitting there with our daiquiris, the three of us afterwards, and Aunt Ellen looked. over the two of us instead. Makes you feel a little guilty, doesn't it? She also told Dad and me a story there that I maybe you all have heard, but I was, I hadn't heard it before. She's, and I guess it came from our drinking the daiquiris and talking about alcohol and When she was a teenager, she was the youngest of the 16. When she was a teenager, she was sitting on a couch uh at the near the front door of the living room. And the door opens, and TS McCallie, who had lost his job as a street car conductor and all sorts of things because of his heavy drinking, he would later go on to be the chaplain of Chattanooga and all that fell through the door. Fell into it face down, can't move, totally drunk. And the old minister walks over her father, TH. Looks up at the sky or the ceiling. And says something to the effect. Great God Almighty. Take him or cure him. And she said she trembled with fear, waiting for the lightning to strike, the ceiling to open up. She didn't know what was gonna happen. Uh, but later, He became such a beloved person in Chattanooga and somebody has seen this written up. But when he died, the family was told that there probably wouldn't be a church in town, large enough to hold the congregation. For the funeral, so they had to have it in the memorial Auditorium, which hadn't been around very long. And because he had gone by as chaplain had gone on by all the police stations or outlets in the fire department, all the firemen, all the fire engines, all the policemen were out on McCallie Avenue to escort the coffin. So he went, uh, so I guess the prayer of his father decades before had must have had some effect. Yeah. Let's see what else. Oh, now Uncle Park did. Can we get rid of the picture so we can see everybody? I can't see everybody. Yeah, can we get rid of the photo?

And it was Jean Fletcher's uh wedding, and it, she had had a morning wedding and it was a very nice brunch at Fairland Club. And uh waiter was going through the crowd with a big tray of Bloody Marys. And we're all talking and there are a lot of the relatives around talking. And somebody says, oh, and they look. Uncle Park has picked off one of these tall Bloody Marys from the tray and is drinking it. And somebody, everybody looks at him and and we had such great respect for him. And you knew how strongly these beliefs were held and what they meant to you, so that people were shocked and they looked at him and he said, this is very tasty. And so the waiter came by again. He finished that one, came back again and he reached out to grab one and one of the ladies close to him immediately uh said, Uncle Park, we will get you a better one. And kind of took it out of his hand and went back into the kitchen or the bar and came out with one and he drank it and I could tell that it wasn't as good. That's the other one. Uh,

          Spencer III: Uh, how about, yeah, I guess I was gonna talk about Uncle Park and Billy Graham. Oh yeah, that, that story is a is a great one, Baylor school sends me a big invitation to come to the dedication of their new chapel. Frank Harrison is the one who gave the money, and I used to say Frank Harrison was trying to, uh, bring Christianity to Baylor. No. I get this big placard, huge thing says VIP and gold on a big red car and they bring me in and I end up parking with Sarah under the wings of the helicopter under the blades of the helicopter. They brought Billy Graham to the Baylor campus to be the dedicatory speaker. And he's just getting out of the chopper. Frank Harrison calls me over and says, I want you to meet Doctor Graham, and I tell him who he is, he says, are you related to Doctor Park McCallie? I said, that's my great uncle, one of the founders of McAuley School. He said, My father-in-law Doctor Nelson Bell loves your uncle, and he just loved Park McCallie said, you know, we, we, uh, this was the first uh crusade, the one I had in McCallie is the first one that was not, uh, that I had in Chattanooga was, was the first one that was not segregated, and I remember your uncle just was, gosh, what a fine man and so we go into the, the, uh, the new chapel it's huge. Beautiful, and Sarah and I try to sit, Sarah, especially, we try to sit toward the backboard, they see us, grab us, put us on the 2nd row, and I'm sitting by the Baylor board chair. And Billy Graham gets up and he looks, he says. This is a wonderful building, he said, I had no idea that it would be so large and impressive. This will be a great blessing to the students and alumni of McAuley far into the future, and the place is stunned, quiet, just stunned, absolutely. No, no sound at all. And Sarah turns to me and looks and I said, Don't look at me. Don't look at me. I'm not, I don't want anybody and, and the chair of the board of the Baylor board to my right turns and looks at me, and I couldn't say anything to him, but it's, it's just silent in there and then he later we found out that one of the women, uh, Sarah Gilman is sitting down below him going. But And later, she tells somebody, I'm sure Doctor Graham looked and thought that poor lady is afflicted. So he said something else. He said so he started talking about how you come to Chattanooga and Doctor Park McCallie, and I'm thinking. Billy, they don't wanna hear this. They're just, they don't wanna hear this later. I won't go any further with it, but he finally somebody told. And on the way out, uh, one of the men turned to me and said, this was a prank called by doctor caused by Doctor Park in heaven. And when by the time I got back to school, it had spread all over town. Everybody in Colwell Hall was waiting at the door. Is it true? Is it true? It was true. All right. Go on what we're going on.

          Spencer III: yeah. For that purpose, and we were asked to help put seats together and they had an iron frame and a bolt bolts and uh boards and I remember going down there. McCallie students went down, gosh, even during the day they would excuse you and they would take uh van loads of us down. We built hundreds and hundreds of those of those seats. The person who takes the. The oxygen out of the air of course is on and. Because of stories and I remember very well. I'll start by I'm in the Pacific on a ship in let's say 1960, and we've just furnished an aircraft carrier and we haven't been in port for some time. And they we finally got mail and we're having a rope yarn Sunday we've cleaned cleaned up after uh an unrep under way replenishment um in the bunks. My very sophisticated roommate from California, Sanford graduate graduate wealthy family. He says he's reading the New York Times, he says, Spencer. Do you know an Ed McCallie from Signal Mountain, Tennessee, said my great uncle. He said the New York Times in their magazine. He says that he is one of the 100 most interesting men to have died this year, people in America. And I said, well, I know him and I can tell you a few stories, but that takes takes me back. You know, the uncle Ed this um. Champion football player, all American halfback. At uh Cornell. I once had one, he gave me a football. I was just the right age to be able to drive myself up there and a couple times I drove him home when he was downtown and he couldn't get home. And so I, I did have kind of a relationship with him and so he gave me the football that had. The 7 to 0 against West Point and all dried up and when I was later in later years disappeared. I think mother threw it away because it was kind of ugly, but uh I had, I had liked it, uh. His His biggest story, I think. is connected with, with this. Dragon Hunt. And look at the picture. Uh, It's not very clear. Let's see. Well, you can very hardly see the picture. It's the picture of a of a man it's With his fedora And he is. Roy Chapman Andrews, who becomes the model for What movie character? You all have been, you've seen him in the movies. Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones. This is the model for Indiana Jones, and in this book, in just one page it describes how this man went into the Gobi to uh gosh, the name of it, they called it at that point Erga. And it was the site of a of a small city, about 30,000, 10,000 of whom were monks, and the leader was called the living god of Mongolia. Later it becomes Ulan Baur after the Russian Revolution. And He goes, Andrews has some uh friends. He sent all his equipment ahead by camel caravan. He has some friends that will go with him a couple and that friend had another couple. Ed and Gwen McCallie. So in 3 cars, they go off 600 miles to Urga. And Uncle Ed loved telling these stories, and I loved hearing them, and later on, uh, in the college years, Sarah would go with me. I think he really enjoyed having Sarah there, so he would talk to the two of us. And he talked about. The hunting and in the book, uh, the author talks about duck and geese and antelope, and all kinds of things that they, uh, shot and ate had a Chinese cook. It was just fascinating, but sometimes I thought it was a bit much and then Aunt Glenn would say something like, oh, the horseman riding across the hills with ribbons in their hair. It was so romantic, so romantic. And then talk about the hunting and she said, oh, and daddy got excited and shot right through the windshield. So he must have seen an an antelope or something and grabbed a pistol and just blown the thing out. They used to have the windshields that could go up and then you'd hold them up. Well, it wasn't, it wasn't up and he shot through it. So there, you know, there were things like that and then Aunt Gwen would immediately. Corroborated in a, in a funny way. He only made that one trip, but later, and the, the leader was of the I guess he was the mayor. They called him the living god of Mongolia, and he asked for. Uh, he wanted a lighting system, so later Uncle Ed would put a general electrical generator in the back of an old Dodge truck and drive it out there. The gasoline would was to come by camel caravan. And uh Doug remembers that I had told and I forgot this part of it that they plugged, set it up and plugged it in and the lights flashed on and everybody fled. They just, what the heck is this? So that's Uncle Ed. Others Uncle Ed told. But he didn't go back there. He, he had left America with uh a job with with Standard Oil. And I don't know where that had gone, but he stayed and he was gonna make a little extra money going into Siberia and bringing out furs, ermine and sable, whatever, and he and the Norwegian and the Norwegian son were gonna go and Gwen went along. And they're in Siberia. The Russian army has arrived, the red Russian and the white Russians have fled. He had already seen white Russian women on the beaches, he said. They would come down to the beach and uh of China and slip off their coats, nude and go into the water. My, they were beautiful women. They were beautiful women. I kind of as a college boy, I like that story too. But These Russian soldiers, the red soldiers, uh, there, there's a party, they're drinking. He is not, uh, can't speak, doesn't quite understand what they're trying to tell him. One of them takes him around to the back, where there's an open place under the building, and there are the frozen bodies of the people who had owned the mansion. Of the Russians who had owned it, and they have been killed in some way and then just their bodies left there. He takes that in the story, he takes that as a warning and says to his partners, we need to get out of here. He said I don't think this is gonna be good. The Norwegian says, I don't think you're reading this right. He said they've been very friendly to us. I don't think you're, we need to go. It's as we do, and then he finds out that they've taken all his cars except an open car. They had a couple cars and it's open and it's it's Siberia and it's very, very cold, so he gets the furs that belong to him and he dumps them in there in the night, puts Aunt Glenn in the bottom. She's on the floorboards or on on furs. And they grease, put grease over their hands and any skin that's gonna be uh. out in the open and have a Chinese driver and off they go. And they go a pretty good distance and they're stopped at some uh with some military guys. And Ed says that they better let him go, that there's a machine gun detachment with Lieutenant Johnson on their, on his way, and they, he makes this known, that of course is a made up story, and they go on, they go into a village that's been abandoned and wild dogs are running in a pack and begin to attack the car, and I'm thinking. This has gone too far. Uh, this, this story is way out there. And Aunt Glen says, Oh my, that was frightening. I remember seeing the heads of those dogs snarling coming over the edge of the car. And Daddy with a club beating them back like some Hercules, and I thought, you know, I guess it happened. Uh, it had, it had to happen. It's just an amazing, an amazing story to me and probably the wildest thing that ever happened to anybody in the McCallie family. I can't imagine and if you know of one that's worth Helen.

She takes a ship all the way back to England, and I think by then it was in World War One and the the the Germans were beginning to use their submarines, and she goes all the way back to England, has a divorce, and then comes back to marry this amazing man she had met in China. And they were all in a way mother felt like she was visiting. Children in some way, happy, happy children. It was Aunt Glen wore a velvet slacks.

          Spencer III: on the Signal Mountain and a house rented. Paid for by Uncle Park. Uncle Park did everything for him and because of that. I mean this is family stuff because of that, uncle Ed. Had these resentments and so. I remember being there one time when. Uh, we're Sarah and I are listening intently to these stories with Uncle Ed. Well, Uncle Park comes, and then, uh, Aunt Ellen and Aunt Mamie Bright come. So Aunt Mamie and Aunt Ellen, they've been on a trip to Europe, and they start talking about going up the Thames and they talk to this Uncle Park's interested in them. Nobody's listening to Uncle Ed. It's, you know, so he, he's just sitting there in a way, a little sullen just kind of sulking just a little bit. And uncle uh Aunt Mamie and Aunt Ellen had brought him a tie made out of some synthetic material that is looks as good as silk. And is washable. And we're looking at Uncle Ed, I am and wondering how long it's been since he's worn a tie. When they leave, he says, well, that is very nice. I have a tie I can wear in the tub. And Uncle Ed, I mean, Uncle Park has, you know, we did I hit the wrong thing here? Oh no, you're good, huh, you're good. OK. Uncle Park has brought him a big hunk of uh Edam cheese, big round of Edam cheese. And he Uncle Park brought him things instead of money because he knew the money would go to the moonshine. And so Uncle Park leaves and he says, Well, when Take dies. I'm gonna have him pressed in the cheese. And I'm gonna give him to park and say here you eat them. So you know we were irreverent enough to to see some humor in that, uh, but there was the fire extinguisher at Christmas, and Uncle Park gave him a heavy old fire extinguisher remember the kind and you were supposed to turn it upside down the things would make things weigh 30 pounds and we got there. It was Christmas time and Uncle, uh, Dad and maybe Uncle T, and I know Uncle Tom Crane. And we said, Uncle Ed, how are you doing? He said, Well, I'm very tired. I'm very tired. Uh, I've been walking around this house with this heavy, uh, fire extinguisher looking for a fire, and I'm really just, just tired. Another time we were there and he, the fire is smoldering a little bit, and he takes a half cup of kerosene and before anybody can stop him, he throws it. On this, this thing, well, we've all been told you can't do that, that it'll vaporize and then make this explosive thing. Well, it did go. And dad and Uncle Tom, they're just shocked, said. I'm glad you can't do that. He said, I don't know why you boys are worrying. I worked for Standard Oil. As if, as if that was reason enough.

          Spencer III: Yeah, we went up there, uh, 1 4th of July. Oh, you know, it's funny, we all went, Oh, he, he just drew our attention. We went up and he had a big bandage on his forehead. We said, well, that said, what happened? He said, oh, I had a I was putting the flag up and sure enough, there's a flag. It only had about 43 stars on it. It was so old, and he tied a rope to it in a rock, and he'd thrown it up over a limb and it had swung down and hit him and they. Dad couldn't help but laugh. I mean, they turned around and they're laughing because just it was always something, always something.

          Spencer III: Got a call one day by then, see, we were still living in Founders's home and had a Uh, shared line with the Presley's upstairs. And dad takes it and says, uh-huh, OK, mhm. Turns around, says, I'm gonna have to go up to the uh to see Uncle Ed. He's chopped his toe off. And so somebody's got to take him to the hospital, so I'll go. So much later dad comes home and said, well, we looked for the toe couldn't find it. But, uh, sewed him up, now he's home and By then it's mid-afternoon and then the phone rings again. And mother goes to it and she says, Uh, yes. Mhm. OK. All right. Well, thanks, Uncle Ed. I, uh, all right, I'll, I'll tell. And hung up, and then she said, Good heavens. Said Spencer. Uncle Ed found his toe. He, he asked, where? It was in his sock. Oh. True story, true story he

          Spencer III: he'd been chopping wood and just chopped it off, which reminds me of the, of one of, of one of the hunting trips they took down to the Omaha, and uncle or grandfather, grandfather Spencer would take boys down. And they were in a winter thing, and he took them down hunting and Jim Bibb and Hattie's nephew. Uh, because Uncle James Bibb, the school doctor, was her brother. He shot his toe off while he went through a fence, and he, he had opened his gun, so he. So grandfather had to take Jim Bill into. The local hospital and have somebody buy our clinic and have him sewed up when he came back. Hardwick Colwell, who later became board chair and all that, was trying to catch catfish with Jim Bibbs toe and so. I asked Hardwick later when he was born here. I said Hardwick. Was that really true? Did that really happen? He said, Spencer, that's the only bait I had. Yeah, it was, it was true. And all of these stories, and it seems to me that there's a Kind of a southern. Or isn't there sort of a southern frontier ring to it, kind of a this, it's very different from what when I would explain to my New England friends and I did have some good friends after years in the Headmasters Association. I have, I have friends from the great West Coast Independent school. When they heard that we had had you in my lifetime. And some of the other things I would tell him. Uh, maybe I told him too much, but one of the things that I remember one of the the meetings and I'm sitting at the table with some. Really nice, uh, men and women, gosh, the most fascinating people to me were the women who ran the girls' schools in New York City. They were the brightest. Uh, they were stars and they put up with a whole lot of blue blood stuff and, and prevailed and somebody said to me and said, all the blue bloods of New York get on their knees and crawl to the desk of John McMenamin to get their school, their daughters in Brier. But they, when I one day they said I told some of these stories, probably shouldn't have. They said, Spencer, when you retire. Are you gonna stay there? So I had, I had overdone it, I guess. Doug, how is

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="4166.258">[01:09:26]</span>
          Spencer III: Pardon? Yeah, one of my regrets. Uh, later was that I had not, when you know, young young teacher living in a dorm, have duty 7 days a week, 3 young children. I wish that I had when I did have some time that I had gone to see those two women. And just been with them and just to hear them talk. I remember, you know, I didn't do that and most people don't do that sort of thing. I wish I had.

          Jack: I remember his kids going up there to that house, uh, and, uh, two points, uh, one of her, your memory of her being very much a great educator and, and. Uh, pushing literacy and stuff. I remember when you got to be 4th grade at Bright School, if you memorize the Gettysburg Address, she would give you $5 which is 4th grade in Bright School was a big deal. Does anybody else remember that? Do you know, David, do you remember that? No, I, I probably couldn't do the memorization and uh. Our next door neighbor is Joe Thatcher, who is uh uh Mamie Brights. His grandmother or great grandmother, I guess I can't, but anyway, we've been having funny conversations just because it's the other side of that duo, uh, generations later that he has memories very similar to our experience up there in that house and all those kinds of things just kind of a neat parallel history.

          <span class="timestamp" data-time="4253.87">[01:10:53]</span>
          Spencer III: Well, Mamie Bright did not come into Chattanooga with money or a lot of connections. I don't think. I think she had a vision for a school and it was not an easy thing for her to to get it going, but she did, and her vision was education should be something that children really enjoy and I think she succeeded. She was great. Thanks again. Thank you. Thank you. Wonderful. Great.

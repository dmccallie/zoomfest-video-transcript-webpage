So it's helpful if those are, you know, very descriptive.</span>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="189.89">may have had a chance to hear it there, and if you didn't, that's okay.

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="221.8">revisit what we talked about at High Rocks. I didn't want to do exactly the same thing. Those of you who sat through that, it was announced as being</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="233.61">new history from Spencer. And I did that with tongue-in-cheek, because I figured everybody would expect more stories from Spencer, when… when in actual, in reality, it was…</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="247.24">new information from the original Spencer McCallie, letters that had not been read or shared with the family. I had come up with these, given them to Spencer, and he did a wonderful job of presenting them late one night.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="266.64">I think those that sat through it had lots of questions, and I didn't want to do the same thing over again. So, consider this sort of new history from Spencer.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="278.7">abridged and annotated, so I've cut down a lot to try to focus on several of the themes that I thought were interesting and</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="289.72">worth sharing. Some of you have not heard any of this, and all of this ultimately will be on the website, the original letters, the translations, that will be something that, in your</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="304.25">spare time, or whenever you want to, you can enjoy in the future. So I've… I've abridged it, I've tried to annotate it, bring out some other thoughts and ideas.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="313.13">the… story of these letters,</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="336.90999999999997">And ended up in my parents' attic for a generation. When they moved out of their house, ended up in our basement, and then in a storage unit. So, their treasures that had been tucked away, and,</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="355.04">not enjoyed until now, and I think one plug I would put in, thanks to Nancy's encouragement, is for all those things you have in your attic that you're ready to throw away.</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="366.79">Pay attention to those that might have some</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="957.53">Dear Ms. Katharine, Dr. Bachman tells me that you have written him indicating that you are thinking very seriously of not coming back to Chattanooga this year, and asking to be released from the arrangement between you and the church for this winter.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="971.04">You, of course, realize that we are under no circumstances insist on you coming back if it was not entirely according to your wishes, and I realize that the reasons that you give the doctor are very persuasive.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="982.7">We would ask you, however, not to minimize the value of the work that you did here. It may be that the results and the work you are now doing in Pennsylvania are more apparent than you found here. Nevertheless, we were most highly pleased, and the doctor is really dependent upon you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="999.81">I, of course, do not know your home conditions and how much you are needed there, but I would say this, that we realize the salary we were formerly paying you has ceased to be what it is when you first came in purchasing power, and if you should come back, we would expect to bring it up to a proper amount.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="1016.99">Personally, I regret very much not having you back.</span>

It was then nearly noon, but I very fortunately did not send him home, but sent him immediately to Mrs. Crow.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3322.27">By night, he had a well-developed case of pneumonia. Dr. Bibb got immediately on the case and secured a professional nurse, a Miss Gregg, to assist Ms. Croak, so as to give him constant attention day and night.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3336.91">His fever was high for several days, above 103. His respiration and pulse worried Dr. Bibb exceedingly, and it looked as if the little fellow would cross the river in a few days.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3348.73">I must confess that I buried him Sunday. I cried most of the day and prayed as earnestly as I know how to God to spare him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3357.55">We were all worried and are all praying for him. Monday, the crisis came, and a rapid change for the better set in, and it now looks as if he'll be up in a few days. He is still in the school infirmary, and he still has a professional nurse.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3371.83">We do not expect to take any chances. He has suffered at times intensely, but always with remarkable fortitude.</span>

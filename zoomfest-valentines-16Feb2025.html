What's been funny is we turn them on, and then we we set it so that the faculty member can just stay on as parents then cycle through but we've we're gonna have to turn off the the AI companion because I don't need everyone to be sent. Everyone's information.

          Sumner McCallie: We can set it so. So we had to change our settings. We've changed it so that it automatically turns it off. You'd have to turn it on. I just don't think it's fair to parents, even if they don't know that it's happening. I want to be clear on that. But also. Yes, you can also set it so that it only sends to the host, or it sends to whoever else. So it's it was kind of funny, and what I can do at this point as well. Just so you have it. I can make both of you Co. Hosts

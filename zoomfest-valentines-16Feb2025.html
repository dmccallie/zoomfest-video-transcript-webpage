She was, we called her our maid, and she was just a big part of our youth, and growing up, and lots of stories to tell. The man is Charles Ragland, and Charles was a big part of the Macaulay family.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2451.6">Charles worked for lots of the family.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2458.952">he worked. I think he worked for Aunt Ann, and maybe Uncle Park. I know he worked for Mother K.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2467.43">Is that just an incredible just a very nice man who did</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2474.64">all sorts of work around our house. Mom said he was great indoor and outdoor. She could let him shine the chandelier, or mow the grass, or whatever, but he was always there on Saturdays. He told me I took care of him as a patient. I took care of his his wife, who lived to be 101 years old. Charles said he remembered when Daddy came home from the hospital as a kid.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2503.35">And sometime recently I found Mother Kay's</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="2510.26">will and just her notes to Daddy, her only son, about where she wanted furniture to go, and who got it, and this, that, and the other. It was her handwritten, you know. Make sure that</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2524.8">so and so gets this, that and the other. And she said, and take care of Charles is a thousand dollars too much, or do you think 500 is more appropriate? So this is back in the sixties, and it was just a tribute of Mother K to Charles Raglan, who had been</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="2543.092">part of many of the Macaulay family over over generations. Truly generations. And I just thought that was kind of neat to see Charles, and he was. He was at our wedding, and we were glad to have him be there, and just it was. It was kind of neat, but I don't know if anybody else has memory of Charles. Aside from I know David does, but I don't know if if Helen, shaking her head so just kind of it was fun to show that part of our family.</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="3360.85">And so that's how we did it. And I'll just conclude by saying that we wanted to set the time fairly quickly in the fall and get on with it, and and so we set it for November 13, th and people have said, Well, why would you choose the 13th for your wedding? Why not a different day like, say, November 6th or November 20, th</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="3388.41">and the answer is, the Yale bulldogs had home football games on the 6th and the 20, th but not on the 13, th</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3457.29">is taken in Seattle, Washington, and in the background very faintly. You can see Mount Rainier.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3473.89">Yeah, so he had to go. He was going you know, naval transport from one place to the next to the next, and it took him a few days to get over to Japan, because that was the era of the Vietnam war, and most of the the planes were heading to Vietnam, anyway. So that's 1 thing. The other thing is</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3495.42">one of the reasons that we pretty much knew we were going to be getting married once Wyatt came back from patrol in July of 71 is before he left on patrol in March or April, early April of 71.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3513.574">He leaves for 2 and a half month, 3 months actually total.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3517.78">and my lease on my apartment with my really good friend Lynn Taft, was going to expire in 1st of June before I got back.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3528.49">so I kind of asked him if we could get married. I you know I kind of proposed to him. I said, why it? My lease runs out in the apartment. June first, st should I, renew it or not</span>

        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3651.016">and we had met in graduate school.</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="3658.82">I was a</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3661.9">in the the we're both art history students. Or I should say, that's how we got into this chapel because we, Nancy, had done some cataloging for for</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3674.93">the David Rockefeller's collection, and so that gave us a an n and as art historians.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3689.07">We really wanted to be someplace that that was quite beautiful, and this was a wonderful setting, but I had been 2 years in graduate school at Princeton University, and my</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3706.97">the man I came to work with. My mentor advisor left and went to Nyu to the Institute of Fine Arts, which is in the Duke Mansion.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3718.0">78th East</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3720.18">Street, right by 5th Avenue, on that corner, pretty much across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So I took classes at the Institute to finish my degree.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3736.16">and remember I had been pretty much in all male environments for a very long times, maybe worse than well, maybe not worse than being locked up in a submarine with all those men. But</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3751.629">so I come to New York, and it was sort of like dying and going to heaven, and it's just a a whole new experience.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3760.81">And the 1st one of the 1st courses I enrolled in was given by the the senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art, and his name was William Rubin.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3773.62">You've got to remember this is 1969,</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3777.57">and it was back in the the bad old days, and professors then sort of would go through the female student body with impunity.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3787.4">quite literally. And this guy was a noted rue</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3793.46">taught at Sarah Lawrence, and would go through the senior class almost every year, any rate at the Institute. In this he taught a seminar on Dada and serialism of which he was the specialist, and it was very exclusive, hard to get in.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3810.55">so he limited it to a select few. There were 14 in the class.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3817.22">and 12 of them were women, and they were. I was one of 2 men.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3822.4">and the other man, who became a very close friend, was gay. So I had this</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3830.01">a very enviable position.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3835.24">But Nancy was at enrolled at Columbia University and getting her degree there.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3843.26">but she lived on East 78th Street and had a job at the met, so she would take courses at the Institute and then have the</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3852.14">have it transferred the credit over to to Colombia.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3856.91">and she had taken a course the year before the Academic year before that Ruben had taught</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3864.58">a lecture course, and she got the highest grade in the class.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3869.52">and she didn't even apply for the seminar. But again he had an eye for beauty. So he contacted her and invited her to come to the seminar, so she was one of the 12 women.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3884.34">So there we were, and I think it was about 3 weeks into the course</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3890.86">I was in the Museum of Modern Art and Library, doing research in my paper for the course, and Nancy showed up also to to undertake</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3903.06">research for her papers, or we obviously recognized one another and started talking.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3909.66">and we went down in the elevator</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3912.97">and went up 53rd Street and crossed over 55th Avenue, and I suggested we go to Scribner's, and this is back in the day when there were such a thing as bookstores</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3926.131">so we went up the spiral</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3931.092">staircase there in in scrimmers. And Nancy. This was also the day of of the Mini skirts, and she was wearing one very attractively.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3943.39">and about halfway up the steps she turned around and said, you wanted to come up the steps to look up my skirt, didn't you?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3953.2">And she mailed me, I mean she was absolutely right, but in my defense I did not enter in the elevator on the way down from the library, so</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3963.013">we. Still, I didn't do that, but she ended up inviting me to her</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3967.43">her apartment for dinner. No, no, no, no! I told you I had to go back to my apartment.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3979.82">anyway. I turned around and looked him in. And he I just he smiled back at me, and he was so handsome I said, oh, what the heck! It was just just crazy.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="3993.13">So I want to go back to that picture. Can we go back to the 1st one. No, the 1st one</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4002.54">so mom was giving</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4007.9">was going to give a I guess the engagement party and her theme was peach of a pear</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4420.62">It was the summer of 1980 and we were in Boston. I was in between the 4th or the 3rd and 4th year of medical school.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4431.825">Nancy was</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4434.44">house, sitting on a beautiful house on the top of Beacon Hill, from for one of the Boston Brahmin families</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4441.73">who had was associated with a private school in Cambridge, and Nancy was there that summer doing an art program. She was. She was teaching a special art program</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4456.34">complicated reasons for how she got there. But basically she had a beautiful house on top of Beacon Hill all to herself all summer.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4465.6">and I was studying Spanish a crash course in medical Spanish that summer, because the plan was to be that I was going to go spend a month</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4475.95">or 6 weeks in Colombia, Colombia in a rural clinic, and I didn't know any Spanish. So for the people who had signed up to do this program in this rural clinic. They gave us a</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4488.34">crash course in Spanish. It turned out we never went because the political situation had deteriorated enough that they decided it wouldn't be safe for us to go, but nonetheless I didn't know that at the time, so I was busily trying to cram Donde. No, a doctor into my head and learn some Spanish, and this was a sunny.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4512.34">beautiful early July afternoon.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4517.01">and I lived in Brookline, Mass. And had taken my bicycle and ridden down the Charles River to the Esplanade, which is a beautiful expanse of grass on the Boston side of the river, where people would just go and hang out on beautiful sunny days, and, you know, set up a blanket on the ground and sit in sun and read a book, and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4537.41">I think I had actually bicycled into a church that I would go to every now and then down downtown Boston, and was on my way home from that is my best of my memory. But anyway, I was looking for a spot where I could set up and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="4553.4">relax and study my Spanish book, and</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="4557.11">there was just happened to be a nice open piece of grass right next to a beautiful young woman wearing a bikini out sunning that Sunday afternoon, and I thought, well, this looks like a good spot.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5460.17">Everybody stopped and talked, and it was just always interrupting things, and nobody was getting any work done. So I would.</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="5466.71">you know. Here comes somebody else, another one of those Macaulays using the damn copy machine. But this time it was different. Well, how is it different? Well, I heard this female laugh.</span>

          <span class=speakertext data-time="5482.06">and I thought.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5484.34">I better go check this one out. Okay. So I got into Duke. But I didn't get any money, because Ronald Reagan had just taken over and he had canceled all the pill grants so so I couldn't go to Duke. So I said, Okay, I'll stay in Chattanooga. And I went up to Spencer and said, Hey, Spencer, I think I'm going to stay in Chattanooga, and I'd like to get into development.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5507.37">What do you recommend? He said. Oh, I recommend you go right back downstairs and talk to Mel Cooper. He's the best in the city. So I did, went back downstairs and talked to Mel Cooper. And what did he say? I said, Let's go have Chinese food. We went out to dinner. That was the beginning of our Chinese food. Okay, so time goes by a little bit, and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5532.55">you know we had the usual ups and downs and offs and ons, and scared and committed, and afraid, and in love, and not in love, and all that. So by Valentine's things weren't going too well. They kind of slowed down, and there was going to be a ballet at downtown at the Tivoli, and so I decided I'd invite Mel to go to the ballet.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5556.32">so I invited them and my mother, who I was living with my parents, they said, Oh, well, mother said, why don't you invite him over for dinner before the ballet.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5566.39">So I did, and if you remember, Queenie.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5569.88">there were hearts everywhere. There were hearts all over the table in the front door, in the dessert, and as we left to go to the ballet she said, Well, why don't you come back after the ballet? I'll have pecan tarts ready for you. And this was Wednesday night, and that's when she fixed them for the church social. So so we came back after the ballet, and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5597.07">there were in the kitchen. Mother had</span>

        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5609.34">and Mel looked at that, and he said.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="5611.62">do you know how to make these? And I said, I've got the recipe, and that was it. But you did make them. Yes, he bought me not too long ago about a thousand of the little tins that.</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6833.72">they were all going to stay and have dinner, and we were getting in the car and coming because we had to make it halfway back to Chattanooga, Oklahoma City. It was</span>

        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6842.29">slower then than it wasn't, and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6846.34">Mother had asked me several questions</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6849.77">about what people like to eat and what what they're getting wrong.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6853.5">and she was had was thinking of ordering champagne and having something else there.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6862.28">and I said, You know, she said, Well, will they do that? And I said, You know I've I've not ever seen any of them drink.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6869.32">and I'm I'm I'm pretty sure, from what I've heard, that they don't really do that much.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6875.58">So yes, have a you know, have a bottle or 2, but then have of</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6881.89">soft drinks or other things.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6884.73">And so so she did, and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6890.18">When everybody got there we were having walking around sort of a reception. Before we left</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6897.97">we had said to the people that were going to carry a tray around.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6902.39">put the alcoholic drinks back on this side because you won't have many takers, and it'll make it easier for people</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6909.11">to pick up their soft drink on that side.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6913.27">And we started recent some giggles from the people that were helping past the drinks and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6926.56">Then we didn't really know what that was about. The next morning when we called.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6932.35">No, I think we had stopped in China. I don't know where we stopped. We called mother and Dad to say Thank you very much for the wedding, for the reception, or on our way halfway there.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6941.87">and she said, I have have one question to ask.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6946.07">We ran out of alcohol, she said. Everybody who</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6951.47">that came up, they would say, No, no! What's in these glasses?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6955.92">And people would say, the server would say, this is water or sprite, or whatever.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6962.78">and their hand would work around to the back. And so the champagne went really, really quickly, and</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=speakertext data-time="6972.03">was was totally empty. Well, before the reception part it was over, which was fine. I just hadn't been around people enough to know didn't think to ask Marshall.</span>
